<h1>Welcome to the Practice Page!</h1><p>
This page is designed to demonstrate some of the ways you can use JAWS' single letter commands to move through and skip around a page for faster and less frustrating web browsing. Web browsing is more of an art than a science, and the key commands you read about in your textbook pages are tools, not magic spells. What you are doing here is learning how to pick the best tool for the job you are trying to do. More than one tool may work and only experience will really teach you which tools you prefer. The goal is to learn to identify what you are trying to do and get it done as efficiently as possible. Surfing the web is like learning cane travel. The first couple of assignments will be like routes--you will be told what to do and what to expect so you can get the feel of things. Then you will be given some solo assignments to learn to problem solve and then some drop-offs to really put it all together. So just relax and remember that the internet is fun. Even when you end up in the wrong place, you learn something new. So let's get started.<p>
Right now you are reading text. You are using what JAWS calls the virtual PC cursor to do this. Basically what JAWS does is take everything on the page and read it in the order it appears in the code. A web page may be organized into columns, but as far as JAWS is concerned, it is one long line going from top to bottom. So when you want to go to the next line or page element, you hit the down arrow and if you want to go back to where you have already been on the page, hit the up arrow. So when we are talking about "above" and "below" we are talking about the reading order, not where the cursor is visually on the page.  One thing about the virtual PC cursor that is really handy is that you can select and copy text from a web page just like you would in a Word document. Just hold down the shift key while moving the virtual PC cursor and then hit control-c to copy. <p> 
Below this is a big block of links. This is a pretty common thing on web pages. Sometimes if the web designer is  thinking about accessibility, they will put a link that says something like "Skip to main text" in front of the clump of links and you can use this link to get past the link clump. A lot of times, you won't find this convenience. These here links won't even work--if you click on them you will get an error message. They are just here to show you how using the letter n will allow you to skip to the next block of non-link (n is for non) text. I would strongly recommend you hit the letter n when you reach the first link.<p>

<p>
Alright, you jumped that puddle. Now if you held down the shift key with the letter n it would take you back to the previous block of text. The shift key has a way of making keys do their opposite. You may have noticed that when you are logging into the computer, how tab takes you to the next control and shift tab took you back to the previous control. This makes sense because when you are typing in a document, you use the shift key to make capital letters--which are the opposite of small letters. Anyways, my point is, that you can add the shift key to any single letter command to go back instead of forward. You may not use this a whole lot, but it's good to know. Now there is going to be another clump of links you will want to skip over.<p>

<h2>Headers: They aren't just for headlines</h2>

Ok, so when you read that last line, JAWS hopefully said "Heading level 2" before it read it. Headings are a way web designers can draw attention to text that is important or the title of a section of the page. Headings are visually larger and bolder than the surrounding text. If a page uses headings, headings make it really easy to skip from one section to another. You can bring up a list of headings on a page by hitting insert-f6. You can jump to the next heading by hitting the letter h. You can even move to a particular level of heading by hitting the number of that heading level. If you hit the number 1 right now, it would take you to the first line on this page because this line is in heading level one style. If you hit the number 2 right now, it will take you to the next section. If you hit the number 3, you won't go anywhere because there are no headings at level 3 on this page. Hitting h or 2 is the fastest way to find your place in this document if you happen to lose it. Heading 1 is the biggest and boldest and as the numbers increase, the size decreases. Headers are used a lot on newspaper websites like the Star-Tribune (www.startribune.com) or City Pages (www.citypages.com) but you will find them on many other sites as well and they are a great way of skimming a page to find out what kinds of information and links are on it. Below this paragraph is going to be a bunch of graphics. 
<p>
<img src="v:\waterfall.jpg" height=630 width=480 alt="picture of Minnehaha falls">;&nbsp
<img src="v:\bayview.jpg" height=480 width=630 alt="picture of the San Fransisco Bay">;&nbsp
<img src="v:\snowwoman.jpg" width=480 height=630 alt="picture of a snowman in front of a front porch. The snowwoman has twigs for hair and thin branches for arms. The house in the background is tope . There is snow on the ground. The eyes are made of pickels and the nose is a carrot and the mouth is celery. The celery is green and the carrot is orange">;&nbsp
<p><h2>Graphics: All the pretty pictures--and the not so pretty ones</h2><p>
A graphic is anything that comes from an image file. It can be a photo like the ones above or  it can be a picture of a button or words in wacky fonts. You may have noticed that JAWS described the above graphics to you. JAWS didn't come up with those descriptions, it just read what is called the alt tag. This is where the web designer put in a description of the graphic for people who can't see it or browsers that can't show it (like those in some mobile devices like cell phones). As you may have noticed, alt tags can contain any amount of useful or unuseful information. If the description of the snow woman picture was annoying you, you could hit the letter d to go to the next different element on the page--the next thing that is not a graphic. You can jump to the next graphic by hitting the letter g. This does not work for graphic links since JAWS thinks of them primarily as links. Below are a few graphic links. <p>
<a href="V:\buybutton.gif"><img src="v:\buybutton.gif" alt="buy button"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="V:\chop.jpg"><img src="v:\chop.jpg" alt="lean cut pork chops"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="V:\most_popular.gif"><img src="v:\most_popular.gif"></a>&nbsp;
<p>

A big part of what makes a web page accessible is whether it is possible to tell what the graphic links are supposed to do. The first two graphic links above were tagged and so we know exactly what they do. The third one isn't tagged so JAWS will say the name of the graphic file. Sometimes you can tell from the context around it what the link does and sometimes you can't. If you were on a website where you are buying DVDs, you might assume the untagged link above would take you to a list of the most popular DVDs on that site. Here is another group of untagged links. Pretend you are on a site selling electronics. See if you can figure out what each does.<p>

<a href="V:\nav_shopcart.gif"><img src="v:\nav_shopcart.gif"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="V:\nav_acct_manage.gif"><img src="v:\nav_acct_manage.gif"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="V:\nav_dvds.gif"><img src="v:\nav_dvds.gif"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="V:\nav_lcdtvs.gif"><img src="v:\nav_lcdtvs.gif"></a>&nbsp;
<a href="V:\20317.gif"><img src="v:\20317.gif"></a>&nbsp;
<p>
So here are the answers. Don't be upset if you didn't get them right. This takes a little practice. The first one was the link to go to the shopping cart. When you are on a site that is selling stuff, you will have a shopping cart or basket (depending on the site) where the site stores the stuff you selected for purchase before you checkout. This link would most likely take you to a page where you can view what is in your shopping cart. The next link is probably for a page where you can manage your account (acct is usually an abreviation for account). If you want to buy stuff from a site they usually make you set up an account with your name, address, email, etc.  The third one is probably a link to go to the DVDs page and the fourth a link to go to the page for LCD TVs. It takes a little practice to get used to abbreviations like these, but once you get to know a particular site or have been to a number of sites, you get used to them. The last one is a trick question. There is just a number and there is no way to tell what the heck that number means. Sometimes there is text around a graphic link like this that will give you a clue, but the only other option is to click it and find out--which isn't always an option if you are worried it will empty your cart or check you out before you are ready.  If it's a site you visit frequently, you may want to get a reader to tell you what it is and then set a placemarker and name that placemarker with a name that makes sense so you can find the graphic link when you need it.<p>
<h2>K is for placemarker</h2><p>
Placemarkers are useful for large pages that you use a lot. Refer to your textbook pages for all of the placemarker commands. You can set either a temporary or permanent placemarker to quickly jump to a certain part of a page. Say for example you use a web based email like hotmail or gmail and you want to jump past all the stuff on your inbox page and get to your messages. You could set a placemarker there and just hit k the next time you reach that page.<p>
<h2>Tables: more than just data</h2><p>
Of course tables can be used to organize information. Your textbook pages have a whole bunch of commands you can use to read tables more efficiently than just using the up and down arrows. But a lot of web pages use tables to make text look all organized on computers with a wide range of screen resolutions. Some web based email providers display the contents of the inbox as a table. A lot of shopping sites will display products you can purchase in a table. So a way of jumping down to these areas of a page is by hitting the letter t. Below are a couple of different kinds of tables, use t to move from one to the next. This first table has 3 columns and 3 rows. That means it has 9 cells. The second table is an imaginary email inbox. Notice that the subject lines of messages are links, that means you can hit tab to go from one subject to the next. The third is a table showing the types and prices of widgets you can buy.<p>
<table rows=3 col=3>

<p>
<h2>X marks the checkbox an other form control commands</h2><p>
Web pages use forms to obtain information from you. This information might be what you want to search for or what you want to buy or who you want to send an email to. The controls that web pages use are the same as the ones you see in dialog boxes, except some are missing. There are no sliders or spin boxes on web pages. You will learn how to use form controls in a later assignment. For right now, what we want to talk about is how form controls can be used to jump around on a page. Below is a list of these commands:<p>
<dl><li> A is for radio button
<li>B is for button
<li> C is for Combo box
<li> E is for edit box
<li> F is for any form control
<li> X is for checkbox
</dl><p>
These commands are very helpful. Say you are on ebay looking to buy a braille watch. You have searched for braille watch" and now need to get down to your search results. Since there is a checkbox in front of every entry in the search results, hitting x will jump you down to the results and you won't have to read all the stuff ebay puts in front of your results. If you know you need to enter what you want to search for, you can hit the letter e until it says search edit. Below are some extra fields to practice these commands: <p>
<form>Search:<input type=text length=20><br>
Search in: <select type=combo><option>entire site<option>movies</select><br>
<input type=reset value="Go">&nbsp;
<input type=reset value="Cancel"><br>
Search for:<input type=radio value=def name=r1>Definitions 
<input type=radio value=syn name=r1>Synonyms
<input type=radio value=ant name=r1>Antenyms
<br>
Username: <input type=text><br>
I accept the terms of the end user license agreement<input type=checkbox><br>
Browse:<input type=radio value=def name=r2>Music
<input type=radio value=syn name=r2>Movies
<input type=radio value=ant name=r2>Books
<input type=radio value=ane name=r2>Posters
<br>
<input type=reset value=Search><p>
<input type=reset value=Clear All>
</form></div><div2>
<h2>L is for list and i is for item in a list</h2><p>
So the title here pretty much says it all. There is a list above and one below for you to practice on.
<ol>
Stuff to do:
<li>laundry
<li>vacuumming
<li>re-groute  bathroom tile
<li>bake grandma's birthday cake
<li>buy CF card for Bookport
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Control-F is for find, since f was already taken</h2><p>
You can search a web page just like you would search a Word document. This is handy for finding one thing on a large webpage. It is useful when you have followed a link to a page that was one of your Google search results. You can find the spot on the page where Google found what you were looking for by hitting control-f and then typing in one of your search terms. Here are a list of things to search for on this page if you want to practice:(you can select and copy the text below and then paste it in the search box)<p>
<ol>
<li>aardvark
<li>edit box
<li>Widget-o-matic
<li>DVDs
</ol>
<h2>Random Stuff</h2> <p>
If you need to refresh a web page, hit f5. F5 is the refresh command in internet explorer and windows explorer when you are managing files. When you refresh a web page, you tell your browser to go back to the site and download the page again so you have the very latest version. Alt-left arrow will go back to the previous page and alt-right arrow will take you forward to the page you were on before you went back. This is useful if you accidentally go back to the previous page. Backspace will also take you to the previous page. These are all commands built into internet explorer.
<h2>Other Stuff</h2> <p>
If you look at your textbook pages, you will see a number of other single letter and insert-function key commands. Make sure to try them out. Most people don't remember them all or use them all, but it's good to know what they do in case you need them sometime.  There is a division in this page you will go to if you hit the letter z. See what happens when you hit p. Why does it do that?  How about insert-f5, what's that do?  It's good to play around. This page doesn't connect to anything so there is no danger of accidentally buying a widget. We have covered most of the most common ones here, but everyone has their own strategies for web surfing. Hope you had fun. Happy surfing!
