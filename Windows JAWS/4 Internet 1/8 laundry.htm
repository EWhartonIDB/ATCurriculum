<center><h1>A Laundry Problem</h1></center> <p>
<p>
     It is Saturday afternoon. Tanya Simon is going to the Laundromat on 
Lincoln Street. She needs to wash her clothes. Tanya doesn't like going to 
the Laundromat. She doesn't like sitting and waiting. It is boring.</p><p>
     There are many people inside. Everyone is washing clothes. Tanya has 
two loads of laundry. One load is for colors, and the other is for whites. 
But she sees only one empty washing machine.</p><p>
     Tanya thinks, "I don't want to wait for another machine. My loads are 
small. I will put them together in one machine. And I will save money!"</p><p>
     Tanya opens the machine. She puts in detergent. She puts in a white 
sweater, red pants, and many other clothes.<p>
     The washing machine stops after thirty minutes. Tanya opens it and 
takes out her clothes. Oh, no! Her white sweater isn't white anymore. It's 
pink! Washing the whites and colors together is not a good idea. And it 
isn't cheaper. Now she needs to buy a new white sweater.
