<h2>New Bed</h2>
<p>
     Parvin Mousa lives in a big city. Her mother lives outside the city, in a small town. Next week Parvin's mother is coming for a visit. Parvin has a problem.</p>
<p>     She doesn't have a bed. Parvin sleeps on the sofa every night. Parvin doesn't mind sleeping on the sofa. It is comfortable, and it doesn't take up a lot of space in her small apartment. But the sofa is not a good place for her mother to sleep.</p>
<p>     Parvin goes to many stores. She looks at different beds. There are hard beds and soft beds, large beds and small beds.</p>
<p>     Finally Parvin finds a very good bed. It costs $500. She buys the bed. Then Parvin spends another $175 on a new pillow, sheets, a blanket, and a bedspread. Parvin thinks, "This will be very good for my mother."</p>
<p>     Parvin's mother arrives on Sunday. "Mother," says Parvin, "You look tired. Do you want to lie down on the new bed?"</p>
<p>     "No, thank you," says her mother. "My back hurts. I can't sleep on a bed. I want to sleep on the floor."</p>
