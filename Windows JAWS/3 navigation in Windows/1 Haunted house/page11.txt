
You lie down on the couch. It feels very good to get off your feet.  You relax knowing tomorrow you can call for help. Just as you fall asleep, you hear a door slam. Suddenly, a very drunk and angry woodsman is yelling at you ... and that is the last thing you remember.
Sorry, you lose, better luck next time.
