Spreadsheet
A table which displays numbers in rows and columns, used for accounting, budgeting, financial analysis, scientific applications, and other work with figures.  People used to use paper spreadsheets; computerized versions have the advantage of being able to perform automatic calculations on changing data. Each location in a spreadsheet is called a cell, and each cell has a number, such as A3, B4, etc.
The value of a cell may be calculated from a formula involving other cells; for example, C5 may be the sum of A5 and B5. If the data entered in A5 changes, then C5 would be automatically recalculated by the program. This feature makes it possible to use a spreadsheet to project the results of a change in one or more factors 
References between cells may be designated as absolute or relative; an absolute reference refers to a specific cell, and a relative reference describes a cell in its relation to the current cell (as two rows above, two columns to the left, etc.). The data within a cell may be a label, a number, or a formula, and may be copied to other cells. There are two- and three-dimensional spreadsheets.
The first commercially available spreadsheet program was VisiCalc for Apple II; now there are spreadsheet programs from Microsoft, Borland, Lotus, and many other companies. Microsoft Excel, Apple Numbers, and Lotus 1-2-3 are popular examples.

table
A presentation of information organized in rows and columns.  Spreadsheet and database programs provide the best tools for working with tables

cell
A box in a spreadsheet or table where data can be entered.

active cell
The cell in a spreadsheet in which numbers or formulas can be entered.  The active cell shows a thick border, and its name is at the top of the screen; also called the current cell.

cell reference
The exact designation of a cell's location in a spreadsheet, indicated by a column letter and a row number.  The address D4 would be in column D, row 4.  Also called cell address.

absolute cell reference
In a spreadsheet, a reference to one specific cell, rather than a relative reference which would indicate the placement of a cell in reference to the current cell (for example, four rows above in the same column). Because cell references in a spreadsheet are relative references by default, an absolute cell reference must be indicated if desired; this is done by different codes in different programs, but often by adding a dollar sign: $A42, $B$12.

formula
a statement that begins with an = (equals sign) that tells the computer what operations to perform to come up with a value for the cell.
You can create a wide variety of formulas in Microsoft Excel, from formulas that perform a simple arithmetic operation to formulas that analyze a complex set of formulas. 

functions
predefined formulas that perform simple or complex calculations. 

array formula
a type of formula that performs multiple calculations simultaneously and then returns one or more results,
