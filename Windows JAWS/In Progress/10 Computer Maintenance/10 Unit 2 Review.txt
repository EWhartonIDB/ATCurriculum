Unit 2 Commands

Below are the commands, by unit, that you will need to know for the unit 2 test. This test will also include all commands covered on the unit 1 test. Because these commands cover a wider range of concepts, that are important but less crucial to computer use, than the commands covered on the unit 1 test, a score of 80% will suffice to pass this test. Take time to review any units and ask your instructor questions you have about these commands.
