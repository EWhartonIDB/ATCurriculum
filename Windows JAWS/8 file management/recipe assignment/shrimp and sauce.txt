Slow cooking shrimp, or any other shellfish, gives you the juiciest, tastiest finish. Here, you want to crowd the pan slightly so the shrimp are halfway between sautéing and braising. Watch them carefully. As soon as they color and feel just firm, get them out of the pan and onto plates.

Cook to Cook: If frozen shrimp are the closest you'll come to the shrimp boat, boost their character by soaking them in heavily salted ice water, in the refrigerator, for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain, pat dry, and they are ready to cook.

*	Good tasting extra-virgin olive oil
*	1 pound raw extra-large (28 to a pound) to jumbo (23 per pound) shrimp, shelled
*	1 large clove garlic, sliced very thin
*	Salt and fresh-ground black pepper
*	3 drops Tabasco sauce
*	1 to 2 teaspoons butter, in thin shavings
*	1 lemon, cut into 6 wedges

1. Film the bottom of a 10-inch straight-sided sauté pan or a 3- to 4-quart saucepan with olive oil. Heat over medium. Add shrimp, garlic, a little salt, a generous few grindings of pepper, and the Tabasco.

2. Cook over medium to medium low, gently stirring often for 3 to 5 minutes, or until shrimp is pink and barely cooked all the way through (cut into one to test if you are unsure). Immediately slip the butter into the pan, stir once and spoon shrimp and their sauce into a serving bowl. Serve right away. 

LYNNE'S TIPS

*	Follow cooking time closely and keep testing for doneness. Overcook shrimp and you'll have something akin to an eraser.


*	Serve the shrimp on a bed of fragrant and rare old-style Carolina Gold rice if you can find some. You'll eat like a Charleston scion. Anson Mills is one online source.

Another alternative is a bed of salad greens, letting the shrimp's pan sauce and lemon finish be their dressing.


*	Swirling a bit of cold butter into pan juices at the very last minute gives you pure butter flavor, creaminess and a sense that the sauce is a lot richer than its fat content reveals. You don't want the butter to melt all the way or you'll lose that cream-like finish.



THOUGHTS FROM LYNNE

When preparing shrimp for cooking the issue of deveining comes up. The dark-colored "vein" that runs along the back of the shrimp is really its intestinal tract. In smaller shrimp it may not be visible at all and deveining is not necessary. 

In large and jumbo shrimp the vein may contain sand and grit and, besides being unattractive, could give a slightly bitter "off" taste to the cooked shrimp. In this case, simply make a shallow cut with a sharp knife along the back of the shrimp and lift the vein out with the tip of the knife. Rinse the shrimp under cold running water, pat dry and it's ready for the sauté pan.
