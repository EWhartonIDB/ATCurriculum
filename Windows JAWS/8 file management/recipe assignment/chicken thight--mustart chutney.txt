When I was in my teens and on a perpetual diet, I was told that white-meat chicken is lower in calories than dark. That's true. But as a grown-up chef I
know it's also true that dark meat is tenderer, juicier, cheaper, and more flavorful than the breast. (This is particularly true of the thighs, which do
not have the tough sinews of the legs.)

Everyone will love this dish. You can omit the jalapeños of you're not feeding chile lovers.
3 to 4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
10 thin slices (5 ounces) pancetta, coarsely chopped (use 4 to 5 thick slices of smoked bacon if pancetta is not available)
1/3 cup mango chutney (preferably Major Grey's), finely chopped
3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
2 tablespoons mayonnaise
2 tablespoons finely chopped pickled jalapeños
2 tablespoons fresh lime juice
4 large bone-in chicken thighs, with skin (about 1 1/2 pounds)
1 1/2 cups fresh bread crumbs
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly oil a rimmed baking sheet. Combine the chutney, mustard, mayonnaise, jalapeños, and lime juice in a large bowl; add the
thighs and toss until completely coated.

Combine the crumbs and oil on a plate; add the thighs, one at a time, and coat with crumbs. Arrange on the baking sheet. Bake 35 to 40 minutes, until cooked
through and the crumbs are golden brown. Transfer the thighs to a platter and serve.
