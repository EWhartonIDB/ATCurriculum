Spiced Spinach with Almonds
Spinci a Padella del Settecento

Serves 4 to 6 as a side dish

Far more exciting than Italy's usual sauté of spinach and onion is Emilia-Romagna's 17th century version of the recipe. In it spinach gains intrigue and
mystique with savory/sweet flavorings of spices, nuts, currants, and cheeses. Serve the dish just as they did centuries ago, as a side dish, especially
with roast capon, chicken, game, turkey, or rabbit. It makes a fine stuffing for pastas, or small roasted birds like Cornish hens. In Romania, the sauté
made without nuts, spices, and ricotta tops hot Piadina flatbread. My own inclination is to keep in the delicious ingredients, cut hot Piadina into small
wedges, top them with the spinach, and serve it as an antipasto or with drinks.

Working Ahead: The spinach can be cooked up to 24 hours in advance. Squeeze out as much of its moisture as possible, wrap, and refrigerate. Sauté shortly
before serving to keep the color bright.

Cooking the Spinach: Heat the olive oil in a 12-inch sauté pan over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté 8 minutes over medium to medium-high heat, or
until golden brown. Stir in the garlic and cook another minute.

Finishing and Serving: Add the spinach, cinnamon, nutmeg, almonds, and currants. Stir while sautéing over medium heat about 2 minutes, or until heated through
and aromatic. Stir in the ricotta and heat a few seconds. Season the mixture to taste with salt and pepper. Turn the spinach mixture into a heated serving
bowl and toss with the Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Serve hot or warm.

Cook's Notes: Using other greens: Swiss chard, turnip greens, broccoli rabe, beet greens, romaine, escarole, curly endive, and young dandelion greens are
all excellent prepared this way. Cook the greens first. They should be crisp-tender but still brightly colored. The tarter greens need longer sautéing
with an additional tablespoon of olive oil.
