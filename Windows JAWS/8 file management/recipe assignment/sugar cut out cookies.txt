Don’t say I never saved your ass.

 

Grandma Bernice’s white-roll-outs:

 

3 cups flour

½ teaspoon baking soda

Pinch salt

½ teaspoon baking powder

 

1 cup butter

2 eggs

1 cup white sugar

1 teaspoon vanilla

 

Mix dry ingredients and then cut the butter in like you would for a pie
crust (of which I know you have made many!), this means it should kind of be
in little pea size balls (so the whole time you should be thinking of lovely
and tasty green peas).

In another bowl beat the eggs real hard, add sugar very gradually then add
vanilla. Mix all together. Chill the dough, roll out using as little flour
as possible, and as thinly as possible. 350 oven. Don’t screw it up.

 

Love,

Secret Santa…oops I mean Carrie
