Ingredients 
2  cups granulated sugar 
2  cups water 
1/4  cup margarine or butter 
1/4  teaspoon ground cinnamon 
1/4  teaspoon ground nutmeg 
2  cups all-purpose flour 
2  teaspoons baking powder 
1/2  teaspoon salt 
3/4  cup shortening 
2/3  cup milk 
1/4  cup granulated sugar 
1/2  teaspoon ground cinnamon 
3  cups shredded, peeled cooking apples (3 to 4 medium), such as Golden Delicious, Rome, Granny Smith, Jonathan, or Newton Pippin 

  Directions 
1. For sauce, in a large saucepan, combine 2 cups sugar, the water, margarine, 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon, and nutmeg. Bring to boiling and boil for 5 minutes; set aside (should have about 2 cups sauce).
