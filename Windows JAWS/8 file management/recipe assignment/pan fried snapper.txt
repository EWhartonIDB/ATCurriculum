Here, I’ve jazzed up store-bought sweet-and-sour sauce with a few additional ingredients. But if you are short on time, you can use the sauce straight from
the bottle. Serve with a bowl of piping-hot steamed rice and some stir-fried vegetables.

Sauce:
2 teaspoons vegetable oil
1/2 yellow onion, finely chopped
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 jalapeño chili, minced
1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and finely chopped
1 cup purchased sweet-and-sour sauce
1/3 cup chicken broth
Salt
White pepper
All-purpose flour for dusting
1 egg
1 1/2 pounds snapper fillet, cut into 4 equal pieces
2 tablespoons vegetable oil
To make the sauce, place a small saucepan over high heat until hot. Add the oil, swirling to coat the bottom. Add the onion, garlic, chili, and bell pepper
and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are tender, 11/2 to 2 minutes. Add the sweet-and-sour sauce, broth, and salt and pepper to taste and bring to
a boil. Remove from the heat and cover to keep warm while the fish cooks.

Place flour in one bowl, and lightly beat the egg in another bowl. One at a time, dust the fish pieces with the flour, shaking off the excess. Then dip
in the egg, drain briefly, and dust again with the flour. Place a frying pan over medium-high heat until hot. Add the oil, swirling to coat the bottom.
Place the fish in the pan and cook, turning once, until golden brown on both sides and opaque in the center, 4 to 5 minutes on each side.

Pour the warm sauce onto a large serving plate, place the fish on the sauce, and serve.
