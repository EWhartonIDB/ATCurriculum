
 Using the arrow keys to read a document  

When reading a document with the keyboard, one method is to use the up and down arrow keys. 
When you open a document the cursor is on the top line , and at the far left side of the document. If you press the down arrow key, you move the cursor down the page one line, and your screen reader will then read that line to you. If you then press the up arrow, you will move the cursor up one line, and your screen reader will read that line to you.
