<h2> 
Her Messy Desk
</h2>
     Ed's boss, Miss Benson, needs to leave the office for a while. Before 
she leaves, she tells Ed what to do.
     Miss Benson says, "Please answer the phone and take messages for me. 
<p>
Please address these envelopes. Oh, and one more thing. My desk is a mess. 
I have papers, books, and office supplies everywhere. Maybe you can help 
me get organized. I'll be back at 2:30."
<p>
     Miss Benson walks out of the door. Ed walks into Miss Benson's office 
and looks at her desk. She is right. Her desk is a mess. 
<p>
Ed sorts through 
the papers. He files the papers in the filing cabinet. He puts books on 
the bookshelf. Then Ed puts away the office supplies: stapler, tape, 
scissors, rubber bands, and paper clips.
<p>
     At 2:30 Miss Benson returns to the office. Ed gives her the phone 
messages and the envelopes. Then Miss Benson looks at her desk. It is neat 
and organized.
<p>
     "Thank you, Ed," says Miss Benson. "You are a wonderful assistant. 
Now please get out all of my papers, books, and office supplies. I have a 
lot of work to do."
<p>
The End.
