<h2> 
Confusing Internet
</h2>
          Emma is at home. She is thinking about her sister Clara in
        Germany.
<p> 
She looks at her watch. She wants to call Clara now, but
        she can't. It's very late in Germany. Clara is probably sleeping.
<p> 
          Emma's son Hans says, "Send Aunt Clara an e-mail." But Emma
        doesn't like the computer. She thinks the Internet is very
        confusing. 
<p> 
Hans tells his mother that e-mail is fast and easy.
        "You need to try it. It is fantastic."
<p> 
          Emma shakes her head. "No," she says. "I like the telephone. I
        never want to touch the computer again."
<p> 
          Hans sits down at the computer. He gets on the Internet and
        checks his e-mail. "Here is a message from Aunt Clara," says
        Hans. "She wants you to visit her in Germany this summer. Open
        the telephone book. Look for a travel agent, and buy a ticket."
<p> 
          Emma sits in a chair next to Hans. "I have a better idea," she
        says. "Let's look for a cheaper ticket on the Internet."
<p>
The End.
