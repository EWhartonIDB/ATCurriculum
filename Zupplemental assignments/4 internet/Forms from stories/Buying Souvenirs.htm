<h2> 
Buying Souvenirs
</h2>
     Leo is on a two-week vacation in Cancun, Mexico. He is having a 
wonderful time. He is enjoying the friendly people, beautiful beaches, and 
delicious Mexican food. 
<p>
Right now it is raining, so Leo decides to go 
shopping. He wants to buy some souvenirs for his family and friends.
<p>
     Leo doesn't like the shops near the hotel. The prices are high, and 
he can buy the same perfume and jewelry at home. He wants to buy special 
things made by the local people.
<p>
     Leo takes a taxi into town and enters a small market. He sees many 
interesting handicrafts. He doesn't see many tourists there.
<p>
     Leo picks up a hat to buy for his father. He opens his phrase book 
and finds how to ask, "How much is it?" in Spanish. 
<p>
"Cuanto cuesta?" asks 
Leo. A man points to the price tag. Leo converts the pesos to dollars and 
figures the hat is about $30.
<p>
     Leo looks in his wallet. He doesn't have much cash. "Maybe there is a 
bank around here," says Leo to himself.
<p>
     "There is an ATM on the corner," says the man in perfect English. 
"And I accept major credit cards."
<p>
The End.
