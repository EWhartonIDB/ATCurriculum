<h2> 
Spending too much
</h2>
     Silvia is a 19-year-old college student. 
<p>
She works part-time in a 
large department store. 
<p>
Every two weeks Sylvia earns about $200. It's not 
a lot of money, but she enjoys her job. 
<p>
Silvia also likes the 20% discount 
she gets on clothes, shoes, and other merchandise. 
<p>
She often spends most 
of her paycheck at the department store.
<p>
     Silvia's mother, Marta, doesn't like her daughter spending so much 
money on clothes. She wants her daughter to use her money for college 
expenses. 
<p>
"Silvia," says her mother. "You're spending too much of your 
paycheck at the department store. You don't need any more clothes!"
<p>
     Still, Silvia buys clothes and then asks for money. 
<p>
"Mom," says 
Silvia. "I need $500 for books this semester."
<p>
     "Where is your money?" asks Marta.
<p>
     "I'm running a little short right now," answers Silvia. "I just 
bought these adorable pink shoes."
<p>
     Marta is very angry. "What? Pink shoes! You  don't have anything that 
matches pink shoes." 
<p>
     "Don't worry, Mom," answers Silvia. "With my next paycheck, I'm 
buying the matching belt and purse."
<p>
The End.
