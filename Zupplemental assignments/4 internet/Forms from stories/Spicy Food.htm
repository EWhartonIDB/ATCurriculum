<h2> 
Spicy Food
</h2>
          Colin and his wife are at an Indian restaurant. 
<p>
Colin likes
        Indian food. It is spicy and delicious. The House of India is his
        favorite restaurant. 
<p>
Colin and his wife look at the menu. Soon
        the waiter comes to take their order. 
<p>
Colin says, "Chicken curry,
        please. And I would like it extra hot."
<p>
          Colin's wife doesn't like spicy food. She says, "The same for
        me, but not spicy. I want it very mild."
<p>
          In a few minutes the waiter brings their plates. They pick up
        their forks and taste the chicken curry. 
<p>
Colin says, "The food
        isn't very spicy tonight."
<p>
          Colin's wife looks surprised. Tears are coming out of her eyes.
        She grabs her water and drinks it all. 
<p>
          "Colin!" she cries. "This is your dinner!"
<p>
          Colin feels sorry. He trades plates with his wife. Colin asks
        the waiter for more water. He gives his wife a napkin to wipe her
        eyes. 
<p>
"Sorry, dear," he says. "Next week we can go to your
        favorite Mexican restaurant."

<p>
The End.
