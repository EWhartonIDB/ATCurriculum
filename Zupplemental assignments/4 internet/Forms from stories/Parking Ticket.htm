<h2> 
Parking Ticket
</h2>
          Hal is driving around the parking lot at the bank. He can't
        find a place to park. 
<p>
Hal sees two parking spaces, but the lines
        are blue. The spaces are for disabled people. Hal is not
        disabled.
<p>
          Hal looks at his watch. He decides to park between the blue
        lines for a few minutes. 
<p>
Hal enters the bank and fills out a
        deposit slip for $400. 
<p>
Hal is happy. He likes to save money. He
        waits in a long line. 
<p>
After 15 minutes, Hal returns to the
        parking lot. There is a police officer next to Hal's car. He is
        writing a parking ticket. 
<p>
The officer asks, "Is this your car?"
<p>
          "Yes," answers Hal. "I can move it now."
<p>
          "Too late," says the police officer. "This space is for
        disabled people only. Be more careful next time."
<p>
          Hal looks at the fee on the ticket. He is very sad. 
<p>
Hal moves
        his car. Then he goes back into the bank. He fills out a
        withdrawal slip for $400. Hal needs the money to pay his parking
        ticket.
<p>
The End.
