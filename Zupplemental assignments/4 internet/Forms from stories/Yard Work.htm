<h2> 
Yard Work
</h2>
     Jack and Susie work in their yard every other Saturday. They each do 
different jobs. 
<p>
Jack mows the lawn. Susie pulls the weeds, trims the 
bushes, and waters the plants.
<p>
     One Saturday Jack goes outside and sees Susie mowing the lawn. 
<p>
"What 
are you doing?" asks Jack. "I always mow the lawn."
<p>
     Susie stops mowing. "I know," she says. "I want to try something 
different. You can do my jobs."
<p>
     Jack is not happy with this change at all. He likes mowing the lawn. 
He doesn't like the way Susie is mowing it. She is starting from the left 
side of the yard. Jack always starts from the right.
<p>
     Jack is frustrated, but Susie is smiling. He picks up a hose and 
starts to water the plants.
<p>
     "Stop!" cries Susie. "Don't water the plants until I finish mowing. 
First pull the weeds and trim the bushes."
<p>
     "I don't want to do it that way," says Jack. "This is my job now. I 
can do it the way I like."
<p>
     Susie turns off the lawn mower. "You win," says Susie. "Go ahead and 
mow the lawn. But tonight you're also cooking dinner and washing the 
dishes."
<p>
The End.
