<h2> 
More Towels
</h2>
Yosef works at the front desk of a very busy hotel. Most of the 
people who stay in the hotel are happy with the service. But some guests 
call Yosef to complain. They have a problem with the parking attendant, 
the bellman, or the housekeeper.
<p>
     Yosef is very pleasant when he talks on the phone. "I'm sorry," he 
says. "We'll see to your problem right away."
<p>
     Today there is a call from a guest in Room 785.
     He is complaining about the housekeeper. 
<p>
"Does your housekeeper speak 
English?" he asks. "She doesn't understand when I ask for more towels."
<p>
     Yosef apologizes and promises to help.
<p>
     Yosef knows that Gloria is the housekeeper on the seventh floor. She 
is a very good housekeeper and speaks English well. Many guests compliment 
her service. Yosef calls her. 
<p>
"Gloria," he says. "The guest in 785 is 
complaining about you. Do you understand that he wants more towels?"
<p>
     "Yes," says Gloria. "I know that he wants more towels. But I don't 
understand why he needs them. His suitcase is already full of hotel 
towels."
<p>
The End.
