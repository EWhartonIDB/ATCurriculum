<h2> 
Rainy Weather
</h2>

          Leo lives in Seattle, Washington. Seattle is a beautiful city.
<p>
        Leo has a good job and many friends. But there is one problem. It
        rains a lot in Seattle, especially in the winter. Leo doesn't
        like rainy weather. He doesn't like wet clothes. He doesn't like
        wet shoes. He doesn't like carrying an umbrella everywhere. 
<p>
In
        September, Leo has time for a two-week vacation. He wants to go
        somewhere warm and dry. Leo decides to go to Cancun, in southern
        Mexico.
          It has good weather and pretty beaches. Leo is very excited.
<p>
          The day before Leo leaves, it is sunny. Leo is running in the
        park. He sees his friend Enrique. Enrique is from Mexico. Leo
        says, "I leave tomorrow. I can't wait!"
<p>
          "Have a great trip," says Enrique. "What are you taking?"
<p>
          "Very little," answers Leo. "I'm just taking T-shirts, shorts,
        and sandals."
<p>
          "Don't forget an umbrella," says Enrique. "In Cancun, this is
        the rainy season."
<p>
The End.
