<h2>Always on the Internet</h2>


Emma is always on the Internet. She loves the computer, and she shops on the Internet. She buys furniture, clothes, books, and any other things on the Internet. 
</p><p>

She also finds a lot of
        information there. Emma sees all the news and reads interesting
        articles about health and fitness.</p><p>

          Emma's son Hans is happy that his mother likes the Internet. He
        is glad that she is not afraid to use the computer anymore. </p><p>

But
        he is worried that she spends so much time sitting in front of
        it. Hans thinks she needs to go out more.</p><p>

          One day Hans walks into the house. "Mom," he asks. "What are
        you doing?" <p>
          "Oh, I'm buying my groceries on the Internet," answers Emma.</p><p>

          "It's a beautiful day," says Hans. "Go to the supermarket. You
        can see people and walk around. It's good for your health."</p><p>


          "Not today," says Emma. "I need to stay inside. It's going to
        rain."</p><p>


          "How do you know?" asks Hans. "You're always inside at the
        computer."</p><p>


          "I know about the weather," says Emma. "I checked the report on
        the Internet."
</p>
The End.
