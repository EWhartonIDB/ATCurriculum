<h2>Expecting a Baby</h2>

Laura and Daniel are married. They are expecting a baby this
    spring. This is their first baby, and they are very excited.
<p>
    Today their family and friends are giving them a baby shower.
    Laura and Daniel receive many things for the baby: a crib, a high
    chair, a playpen, a baby swing, a car seat, and a stroller. They
    also receive a lot of clothes and toys. 
<p>
    Laura and Daniel thank
    all of the guests. They appreciate the generous gifts very much. Now they have everything they need.
<p>
      After the shower, Daniel and Laura take the baby gifts back to their one-bedroom apartment. It is very crowded.
 Daniel puts the boxes on the floor. There is no room to walk. Laura puts the clothes and toys on the sofa. There is no room to
    sit. 
<p>
&quot;We need to move to a larger apartment,&quot; says Daniel.
<p>
&quot;Yes,&quot; says Laura. &quot;Babies are small, but their things are very     big.&quot;
<p>
      &quot;Let's buy a newspaper,&quot; says Daniel. &quot;I want to look for a
    two-bedroom apartment.&quot;
<p>
&quot;OK,&quot; says Laura. &quot;But let's read the newspaper at the coffee
    shop. There is no room to read here.&quot;
<p>
The End.
