<h2> 
Late with the Rent
</h2>
     Every month Vera collects the rent from the tenants in her apartment 
building. Most of the tenants are very responsible and pay on time. 
<p>
However, there is one tenant who is always late. It is Miss Walker in 
apartment 3-B.
<p>
     Miss Walker has many excuses for not paying her rent on time. One 
month she says her paycheck is late. The next month she says there is a 
problem at the bank. "Sorry," Miss Walker says to Vera every month. "It 
isn't my fault."
<p>
     Vera feels annoyed by Miss Walker's excuses. Still, Miss Walker is a 
pleasant person, and she gets along with the other tenants.
     But after Miss Walker is one week late with the rent, Vera knocks on 
her door. 
<p>
"I'm sorry about your problems," says Vera. "But your rent is 
due on the first day of every month. Today is the seventh. You need to pay 
it."
<p>
     "Oh, of course," says Miss Walker. She gets out her checkbook and 
writes Vera a check for $500. 
<p>
"Just don't cash this before the tenth," 
says Miss Walker. "It isn't my fault, but right now there is no money in 
my checking account."
<p>
The End.
