<h2> 
Terrible Food
</h2>
     Chan works in a retirement home and helps take care of the elderly 
people living there. 
<p>
Most of the people are very nice, but Mrs. Stevens is 
always complaining about something. For one thing, she always criticizes 
the food. 
<p>
It's never right. The meat is tough. The vegetables are 
overcooked. The butter is hard and the bread is stale.
<p>
     One day Mrs. Stevens is eating chicken noodle soup.
<p>
     "How is it?" asks Chan.
<p>
     "It's terrible," says Mrs. Stevens. "They can't make chicken noodle 
soup here. I have a recipe for chicken noodle soup that is much better."
<p>
     "Can you give me the recipe?" asks Chan. "I will give it to the 
cook."
<p>
     Mrs. Stevens writes down the recipe and Chan gives it to the cook. 
<p>
Chan is very excited. Finally she can give Mrs. Stevens some food she 
likes.
<p>
     Next Tuesday, Chan brings Mrs. Stevens a bowl of soup. "I hope you 
like it," says Chan. "The cook followed your recipe exactly." Mrs. Stevens 
picks up her spoon and tastes the soup. "
<p>
How is it?" asks Chan.
     "It isn't very good," says Mrs. Stevens. "I never liked that recipe."
<p>
The End.
