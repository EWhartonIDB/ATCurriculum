                             Expecting a Baby

     Laura and Daniel are married. They are expecting a baby this spring. 
This is their first baby, and they are very excited. Today their family 
and friends are giving them a baby shower. Laura and Daniel receive many 
things for the baby: a crib, a high chair, a playpen, a baby swing, a car 
seat, and a stroller. They also receive a lot of clothes and toys. Laura 
and Daniel thank all of the guests. They appreciate the generous gifts 
very much. Now they have everything they need.
     After the shower, Daniel and Laura take the baby gifts back to their 
one-bedroom apartment. It is very crowded.
     Daniel puts the boxes on the floor. There is no room to walk. Laura 

puts the clothes and toys on the sofa. There is no room to sit. "We need 
to move to a larger apartment," says Daniel.
     "Yes," says Laura. "Babies are small, but their things are very big."
     "Let's buy a newspaper," says Daniel. "I want to look for a 
two-bedroom apartment."
     "OK," says Laura. "But let's read the newspaper at the coffee shop. 
There is no room to read here."

     Leo is on a two-week vacation in Cancun, Mexico. He is having a 
wonderful time. He is enjoying the friendly people, beautiful beaches, and 
delicious Mexican food. Right now it is raining, so Leo decides to go 
shopping. He wants to buy some souvenirs for his family and friends.
     Leo doesn't like the shops near the hotel. The prices are high, and 
he can buy the same perfume and jewelry at home. He wants to buy special 
things made by the local people.
     Leo takes a taxi into town and enters a small market. He sees many 
interesting handicrafts. He doesn't see many tourists there.
     Leo picks up a hat to buy for his father. He opens his phrase book 
and finds how to ask, "How much is it?" in Spanish. "Cuanto cuesta?" asks 
Leo. A man points to the price tag. Leo converts the pesos to dollars and 
figures the hat is about $30.
     Leo looks in his wallet. He doesn't have much cash. "Maybe there is a 
bank around here," says Leo to himself.
     "There is an ATM on the corner," says the man in perfect English. 
"And I accept major credit cards."

     Every month Vera collects the rent from the tenants in her apartment 
building. Most of the tenants are very responsible and pay on time. 

However, there is one tenant who is always late. It is Miss Walker in 
apartment 3-B.
     Miss Walker has many excuses for not paying her rent on time. One 
month she says her paycheck is late. The next month she says there is a 
problem at the bank. "Sorry," Miss Walker says to Vera every month. "It 
isn't my fault."
     Vera feels annoyed by Miss Walker's excuses. Still, Miss Walker is a 
pleasant person, and she gets along with the other tenants.
     But after Miss Walker is one week late with the rent, Vera knocks on 
her door. "I'm sorry about your problems," says Vera. "But your rent is 
due on the first day of every month. Today is the seventh. You need to pay 
it."
     "Oh, of course," says Miss Walker. She gets out her checkbook and 
writes Vera a check for $500. "Just don't cash this before the tenth," 
says Miss Walker. "It isn't my fault, but right now there is no money in 
my checking account."

                             Birthday Sweater

     Every year on her birthday, Alma receives a gift from her 
grandmother. It is always a knitted sweater. Alma loves her grandmother, 
but never likes the sweater. It is too long, too short, too wide, or too 
narrow. Alma doesn't like the color or the style. It also feels very 
itchy.
     Alma puts the sweater in the closet and writes a thank-you note. 
"Thank you for the beautiful sweater. It's perfect. You are so 
thoughtful."
     One week before Alma's birthday, she gets a call from her 
grandmother. "Sorry, Alma," says her grandmother. "I don't have time to 

knit you a sweater this year. I have to give you something small."
     Alma feels very happy. Maybe her grandmother is giving her money. 
Maybe it is a gift card to her favorite department store. Then she can buy 
a sweater that fits. She can buy her favorite color and style. She can buy 
a sweater that feels soft.
     On her birthday, Alma goes to her grandmother's. Her grandmother 
says, "Happy Birthday," and hands her a small package. Alma opens it. It 
isn't money or a gift card. It is a very itchy hat.

Answer the questions.

1.  When does Alma receive a gift from her grandmother?
2.  What is the gift?
3. What is wrong with the sweater?
4. Does Alma like the color and the style?
5. How does the sweater feel?

     Beth's son Ryan is a big baseball fan. Every summer Beth takes Ryan 
to one major-league game. Beth can't afford to go to more than one game a

park and then buy their tickets. The tickets are $35 each. Ryan wants a 
program and Beth pays another $10.

Ryan and Beth costs $22. Ryan asks his mother to buy a baseball cap from 
the gift shop. It's $19. Beth adds up the money she is spending. So far 
it's $141.

too. She can stop spending money for a while. Ryan sees his favorite 
player, Hank Harper, talking to some fans. Ryan wants to ask for his 
autograph. Beth says it's OK. Ryan runs to the railing and leans over. 
"Mr. Harper!" calls Ryan. "May I please have your autograph?"

autographed picture for only $50."

                                Yard Work

     Jack and Susie work in their yard every other Saturday. They each do 
different jobs. Jack mows the lawn. Susie pulls the weeds, trims the 
bushes, and waters the plants.
     One Saturday Jack goes outside and sees Susie mowing the lawn. "What 
are you doing?" asks Jack. "I always mow the lawn."
     Susie stops mowing. "I know," she says. "I want to try something 
different. You can do my jobs."
     Jack is not happy with this change at all. He likes mowing the lawn. 
He doesn't like the way Susie is mowing it. She is starting from the left 
side of the yard. Jack always starts from the right.
     Jack is frustrated, but Susie is smiling. He picks up a hose and 
starts to water the plants.
     "Stop!" cries Susie. "Don't water the plants until I finish mowing. 
First pull the weeds and trim the bushes."
     "I don't want to do it that way," says Jack. "This is my job now. I 
can do it the way I like."
     Susie turns off the lawn mower. "You win," says Susie. "Go ahead and 
mow the lawn. But tonight you're also cooking dinner and washing the 
dishes."

soup here. I have a recipe for chicken noodle soup that is much better."
     "Can you give me the recipe?" asks Chan. "I will give it to the 
cook."
     Mrs. Stevens writes down the recipe and Chan gives it to the cook. 
Chan is very excited. Finally she can give Mrs. Stevens some food she 
likes.
     Next Tuesday, Chan brings Mrs. Stevens a bowl of soup. "I hope you 
like it," says Chan. "The cook followed your recipe exactly." Mrs. Stevens 
picks up her spoon and tastes the soup. "How is it?" asks Chan.

                            Spending Too Much

     Silvia is a 19-year-old college student. She works part-time in a 
large department store. Every two weeks Sylvia earns about $200. It's not 
a lot of money, but she enjoys her job. Silvia also likes the 20% discount 
she gets on clothes, shoes, and other merchandise. She often spends most 
of her paycheck at the department store.
     Silvia's mother, Marta, doesn't like her daughter spending so much 
money on clothes. She wants her daughter to use her money for college 
expenses. "Silvia," says her mother. "You're spending too much of your 
paycheck at the department store. You don't need any more clothes!"
     Still, Silvia buys clothes and then asks for money. "Mom," says 
Silvia. "I need $500 for books this semester."
     "Where is your money?" asks Marta.
     "I'm running a little short right now," answers Silvia. "I just 
bought these adorable pink shoes."
     Marta is very angry. "What? Pink shoes! You  don't have anything that 

matches pink shoes." 
     "Don't worry, Mom," answers Silvia. "With my next paycheck, I'm 
buying the matching belt and purse."
