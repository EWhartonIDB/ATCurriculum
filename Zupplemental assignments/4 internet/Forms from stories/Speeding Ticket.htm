<h2> 
Speeding Ticket
</h2>

     Hal is waiting in his car at a red light. He is in a big hurry 
because he needs to be at work in 10 minutes. Finally the light turns 
green. Hal begins to drive faster.
<p>
     Now Hal is driving 45 miles per hour. The speed limit on this street 
is 35. 
<p>
Hal approaches another intersection. The light is yellow. Hal 
presses the gas pedal and goes through the intersection at 50 miles per 
hour. "I made it!" says Hal.
<p>
     Hal looks in his rearview mirror. He sees a flashing light. "Oh, no," 
he says. It's a police car. Hal pulls over to the side of the road. The 
officer gets out of his car and comes up to Hal's window.
<p>
     "May I see your license and registration?" asks the police officer.
<p>
     "Of course, Officer," says Hal. "Is there a problem?"
<p>
     "Yes, there is. You were driving 25 miles an hour over the speed 
limit. You're getting a speeding ticket."
<p>
     "I'm sorry," says Hal. "I'll never do that again." 
<p>
     "Good," says the officer. "It isn't safe."
<p>
     "I agree," says Hal. "It isn't safe to speed when a police officer 
sees you."
<p>
The End.
