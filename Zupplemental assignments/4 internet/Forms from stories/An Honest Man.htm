An honest Man
</h2>

          Daniel is at a restaurant. He is having lunch alone. He feels
        something on the floor near his foot. Daniel looks under the
        table. There is a wallet with $120 and a credit card inside.

        Daniel looks for identification. He finds a driver's license. The
        address is near the restaurant.
<p>
          Daniel eats his lunch and leaves the restaurant. He walks down
        the street, finds the house, and knocks at the door. A beautiful
        woman opens the door. "
<p>
"May I speak to Laura?" asks Daniel.
<p>
          "I am Laura," she answers.

          Daniel gives her the wallet. He says, "I found your wallet at
        the restaurant."
<p>
          Laura is very happy. She opens the wallet. All of her money is
        there.

"Please let me take you to lunch tomorrow," says Laura.
