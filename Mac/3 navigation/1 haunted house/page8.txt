
You look around the living room and find a doorway that leads to a room with tile flooring. You think it’s probably a kitchen. You are very hungry and very tired. You could go into the kitchen and look for some food, or lie down on the sofa and sleep.
If you want to look for some food, go to page 10.
If you want to go to sleep, go to page 11.
