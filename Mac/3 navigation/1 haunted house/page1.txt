
It’s late at night and you have been walking through the woods for hours. Nothing is familiar except the hoots of owls and crunch of dried leaves beneath your feet. You are cold and hungry and you are becoming scared. Suddenly in the distance, you hear wind chimes. You run toward them. You find a clearing with a single house. Slowly you climb the creaking stairs. Hesitantly, you knock on the door. There is no answer, so you try again. Still there is no answer. Slowly you turn the knob and walk inside. In front of you there is a closed door and a set of stairs leading upward.
If you want to go up the stairs, go to page 2.
If you want to go through the door, go to page 3.
