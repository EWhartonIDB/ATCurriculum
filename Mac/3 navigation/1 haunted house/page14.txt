
The old man disappears for a moment and returns with a steaming mug. The cocoa tastes wonderful. The two of you sit by the fire and talk for several hours. He is a very interesting fellow. If you didn't know better, you would swear he was the ghost of Ralph Waldo Emerson.  Finally, he shows you to the guest room and you get a few good hours of sleep.
When you wake up you find yourself in your own bed. It must have all been a dream, or was it?
Congratulations! You win!
