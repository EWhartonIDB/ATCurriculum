
You reach the top of the stairs and notice a very unpleasant smell. Suddenly, there is a shriek, then another. The air is filled with shrieks, and bats! They are diving at you. You start to run, but they are coming at you from all sides. Suddenly, the bats are gone, but you realize that you are falling. You must have fallen out the window.
Sorry, you lose, better luck next time.
