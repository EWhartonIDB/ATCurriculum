This is the first paragraph. A paragraph is a block of text. Usually it is made up of sentences that go together to form a complete idea. This paragraph is probably only part of an idea.

This is the second paragraph. The first paragraph was probably put together a little better. I am trying to create this assignment in a hurry.

This is the third paragraph. It comes after the second paragraph. It also comes before the fourth paragraph.

This is the fourth paragraph. It is probably the last paragraph I am going to put on this page. I am getting a little tired of typing paragraphs.

This is the last line of the document.
