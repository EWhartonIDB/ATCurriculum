Serves 1, multiplies easily
List of 12 items
• 1 small (6 ounces or so) steak (chuck, rib-eye or top sirloin), ideally cut 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick)
• 1/16 to 1/8 teaspoon salt
• 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
• 1 large handful organic spring mix or baby lettuces
• Good tasting extra-virgin olive oil
• 1/2 medium onion, thinly sliced
• 1 large clove garlic, minced
• Handful fresh basil leaves, torn
• 1/4 cup cider vinegar
• 1 ripe large tomato, chopped, or 2 canned tomatoes
• 3 generous tablespoons freshly grated Asiago or Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese
• 3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts (optional)

1. Sprinkle the steak with the salt and pepper. Pile the greens on a dinner plate. Lightly film a 10-inch skillet with olive oil. Put over medium heat.
When hot, add the steak. Cook 1 minute on one side, or until browning, then brown fast on second side. Have a 12-inch square piece of foil handy (to save
cleanup).

2. Immediately turn heat down to medium low and cook steak, turning often, 5 to 8 minutes, or until an instant reading thermometer inserted in its center
reads 125° to 130° for medium rare, or 140° for medium. When the steak is done, remove it to the foil.

3. Pour all but a thin film of fat from the pan. Flip the heat to medium high and add 2 tablespoons or so of olive oil to the pan along with the onions
and garlic. Sauté 1 minute. Stand back as you stir in the vinegar. Boil down by half. Stir in basil and tomatoes and cook at a boil another minute. Turn
off heat.

4. Slice steak and pile it and its juices onto the salad; scrape pan sauce over all and sprinkle with the cheese and pine nuts if using.

LYNNE'S TIPS
List of 3 items
• In an interview last spring, food scientist Harold McGee explained that you speed up cooking if you turn steaks and chops frequently. You don't give their
sides a chance to cool down.
• This is one of those recipes you can hang your hat on, changing it to seafood, other meats or chicken, and switching seasonings. Think sautéing curry
powder with the onion and garlic, chiles, or sliced apples. Finish the sauce with herbs, skipping the tomato.
• Bagged salad greens are handy for quick meals. Buy organic when possible and check the pull date on the package to ensure you're buying the freshest greens
available. They are very perishable so use soon after purchase.
