Serves 2 to 3, and doubles easily

Cook's Note: In the best of all possible worlds you want shrimp farmed in the United States or caught wild off our coasts or those of British Columbia.
Because of health and ecological concerns, avoid shrimp farmed and/or caught outside our country and the waters of British Columbia. For more information

Marinade:

• 4 large cloves garlic, peeled 
• 1/4 medium to large onion, sliced 
• 1/4 to 1/3 cup Spanish sherry vinegar 
• 2 tablespoons brown sugar 
• 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper 
• 3 tablespoons water

• 1 pound large or jumbo fresh shrimp, peeled, deveined, rinsed and patted dry 
• Salt and fresh ground black pepper 
• Freshly ground black pepper 
• Good tasting extra-virgin olive oil 

1. Combine in a blender or food processor the garlic, onion, 1/4 cup vinegar, sugar, pepper, and water. Puree and taste, adding more pepper if needed; also
check for a pleasing sweet-tart balance and add more vinegar if needed. Place shrimp in a shallow container and pour over marinade, turning the shrimp
to coat. Refrigerate 10 to 15 minutes.

2. To cook, lift the shrimp out of the marinade and pat dry (reserve the marinade). Lightly film the bottom of a 10-inch heavy skillet with oil and set
over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp, sprinkling them with salt and pepper. Quickly sear on one side, then the other. Immediately lower heat to medium-low
and cook another 1 minute per side, or until the shrimp are opaque on the outside but still slightly translucent on the inside. Do not overcook. Remove
the shrimp to a serving bowl.

3. Turn the heat back up to high, add the reserved marinade and boil it down, stirring with a flat bottomed wooden spatula until syrupy. Take care not to
burn it. Add the shrimp back to the pan just long enough to coat it with the glaze and turning everything back into the serving bowl. Scrape every bit
of glaze out of the pan. Serve the shrimp hot with rice, or rice noodles.

LYNNE'S TIPS

• This marinade/sauce works with salmon, poultry, pork, and lamb.

• Buy fresh shrimp no more than one day before cooking. Keep it buried in ice.

• Buy where turnover is fast and seafood is kept on ice. The display cases should be pristinely clean and there should be no "fishy" aroma in the area.


• Frozen can be best (and 99% of shrimp is frozen when caught and defrosted in the market). If you live where fresh seafood is not popular or readily available
locally, frozen can be fresher than fresh. If fish is caught and immediately frozen on board ship, or on a day boat that returns to port each evening,
it will be in excellent shape. Defrost in the refrigerator.

• Fill a shallow plastic container with ice and nestle seafood into it and refrigerate.

• Keep fish marinating time short (15 to 30 minutes, depending upon the fish), and always marinate in the refrigerator.

• Leftover shrimp go well in a salad of mixed greens the next day.
