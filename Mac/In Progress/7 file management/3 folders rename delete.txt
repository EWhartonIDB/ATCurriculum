Creating folders and renaming files

To create a new folder, navigate to the drive or folder inside of  which you would like to create a new folder using Finder. Then either use the keyboard shortcut for creating a new folder or find this option in the file menu. You will then need to type in a name for the folder and hit the enter key. 

To delete a file or folder, select the file or folder and hit command-delete
Note: on a personal Mac, this command will work immediately, moving items you delete to the trash. On our network, the computer will ask you to confirm that you want to delete an item, because it permanently deletes the file and cannot be recovered.

To rename a file or folder, hit the enter key, type in the new name, and hit enter. Remember to type the file extension (the period and the letters after it).
