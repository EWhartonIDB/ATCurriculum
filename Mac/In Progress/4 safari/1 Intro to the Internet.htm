<h1>Form Controls and How They Work</h1>
<p>Forms are how people communicate with web pages. They contain different types of controls that are designed to get information. Some fields allow you to type any answer, some only want you to choose yes or know, and others give you a set of choices.</p>
<h2>Forms Mode</h2>
<p>In order to put information into a form, you need to enter forms mode. This is because JAWS allows you to use the alphabet keys for navigating web pages more efficiently as you will see shortly, so JAWS needs to know if you meant the letter you typed to actually type a letter or move you somewhere on the page. You must be on a form control in order to turn on forms mode. Press spacebar to enter forms mode. When forms mode turns on, you will hear a high pitch beep.</p>
<p>Sometimes you need to exit forms mode to choose an option or to read the text around a form control. Escape is the easiest way to exit forms mode. When you exit forms mode, you will hear a lower pitch beep.</p>
<h2>Edit Box</h2>

<p>Edit boxes are where you type in text. They are often used when you are searching for something or when you need to type in an address. Here are some edit boxes:</p>
<p>Enter your name: <input type=text name="name" size="40" maxlength="40"></p>
<p>Address: <input type=text name="address" size="40" maxlength="40"></p>
<p>City: <input type=text name="city" size="40" maxlength="40"></p>
<p>Some edit fields are used to enter passwords. When you type in these fields, only stars are visible on the screen and JAWS says star instead of the letter you type. This is to protect the privacy of your password. Here is a password field:</p>
<p>Pretend Password: <input type=password name="email" size="40" maxlength="40"></p>

<h2>Combo Boxes</h2>
Combo boxes are drop down lists of options. You can use alt-down arrow to open a combo box. As you arrow down the list, the item that JAWS speaks is the item that is currently selected. To choose an option, exit forms mode while the option you want is selected. Here are a few combo boxes:</p>
<p>State: 
<select name="4" size=1>
<option>Alabama </option>
<option>California </option>
<option> Iowa </option>
<option> Minnesota </option>
Ohio</option>
Pennsylvania</option></select> </p>
<p>Time Zone: 
<select name="4" size=1>
<option>Pacific</option>
<option>Mountain</option>
<option> Central</option>
<option> Eastern </option>
</select> </p>
<h2>Radio Buttons</h2>
<p>Radio buttons look like hollow circles. When you choose one, it puts a dot in the center of it. Use the spacebar to check a radio button. Only one radio button in a set can be chosen. If you choose another one, the first one will be automatically unselected. Here are two sets of radio buttons:</p>

<p>Gender><input type="radio" name="Gender" value="Male">Male<br><input type="radio" name="Gender" value="Female">Female </p>
<p>

Choose a complementary gift::<br><input type="radio" name="gift" value="toaster">Toaster oven<br><input type="radio" name="gift" value="waffle">waffle iron </p>
<p>
<h2>Checkboxes</h2>
<p>Check boxes are empty squares. Checkboxes are like light switches, they are either on or off. They can only be checked or unchecked; if you have a list of check boxes, you can check as many as you want. Check a checkbox with the spacebar. Here are some checkboxes:</p>
<p>
<input type="checkbox" name="newsletter">Check here to receive our email newsletter.</p>

<p>
<input type="checkbox" name="done" required>Check here to indicate you have finished the assignment</p>
<h2>Buttons</h2>
Buttons are mostly used to submit a form when you are done with it. They can also be used to reset a form and remove all of the information from it. You hit enter to press a button. Here are some buttons to look at; don't press them:</p> 
<p><input type="reset" value="Reset this form"></p>

</form>


<p><input type="submit" value="OK, submit this form"></p>

</form>


<p>So there you have the most common types of form controls that you will find on web pages; please let your instructor know when you have finished so that he/she can come check your work. Have fun!</p>
