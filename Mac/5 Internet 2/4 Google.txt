Google and most other search engines generally work in the same way.


There is an edit box near the top of the page where one can type a word, phrase or sentence to search for, then the search results will appear lower on the page with each search result beginning with a heading.


Go to www.google.com

	
Answer each question below.
Think carefully about what words you type in the search box and what words you can use to most easily get the answer. 
All of these answers can be found without actually clicking on a single link, as the answers appear in the brief description below the heading for each result.
