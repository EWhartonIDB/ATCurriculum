Beached elephant eal blocks South Africa office entrance

CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP)

Office workers shaking off the Monday morning blues after the weekend found the entrance to their posh, waterfront office building blocked by a one-ton (0.91-metric ton) beached eal. 

With the 4.6-meter (5-yard) elephant eal stretched out in front of the office's main entrance, workers were forced to use side entrances. 

The eal ended up by the doors at 3 a.m. Monday, after spending a few days on Cape Town's beaches. It remained in position Monday afternoon. 

The huge mammal is part of a colony that lives near Gough Island, some 2,350 kilometers (1,500 miles) southwest of Cape Town, said Ralston Lewis, a member of the Wildlife Society. 

The eal -- which at age 8 is two years from maturity -- somehow got off its normal course, perhaps in an attempt to avoid sharks or killer whales or pushed by strong currents. When it came across the warmer water near Cape Town's coast, it started shedding hair, as elephant eals do. 

The shedding weakens the eals, which normally beach themselves to avoid predator attacks. Instead of hunting for their normal diet of large fishes, squid and the occasional penguin, they live off their blubber while gathering strength. 

"This is the first time ever recorded that an elephant eal has landed in South Africa," Lewis said. 

The eal has taken a few short swims since arriving. It is expected to return to the sea for a swim within a day or two and to leave Cape Town altogether within four days, Lewis said.
