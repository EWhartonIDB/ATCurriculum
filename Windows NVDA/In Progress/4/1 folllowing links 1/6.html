<p>Cool, Now let's talk about visited and unvisited links. Visited  links are links to pages you have been to before.  Unvisited links are links to pages you haven't been to before. Your screen reader will tell you if a link is visited or unvisited. On the screen this is indicated by different colors. </p>
<p>Now find the link below that is unvisited. That link will take you to the next part of this assignment. Be careful, if you pick a visited link, it will take you all the way back to the beginning.</p>
