It's not until around Labor Day that the sweet, thick-fleshed golden bell peppers are finally ready. This pasta is one way to celebrate them, along with
the end of the summer. The little tomatoes, which are left whole, explode in your mouth. If you peel the peppers with a vegetable peeler, they'll get a
silky texture and leave no unpleasant scrolls of skin. Peppers with nice flat sides are the easiest ones to peel. This pasta is vegan as is, but I would
follow it with a selection of goat cheeses and white nectarines for dessert.

A crisp, chilled white that is also a little fruity - a Sauvignon Blanc, Pinot Blanc, or Chenin Blanc - would support this robust late-summer dish.

Note: Cook the peppers and onions while the water is coming to a boil. Then cook the pasta and combine with the uncooked tomatoes.
List of 11 items
• Sea salt and freshly ground pepper
• 3/4 pound spaghetti
• 2 tablespoons olive oil, plus extra to finish
• 4 to 5 golden bell peppers, peeled and cut lengthwise into 1/2-inch strips
• 1 red onion, thinly sliced
• 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
• 1/2 cup dry white wine
• 1/2 cup chopped black olives
• 3 tablespoons salt capers, rinsed and soaked
• 2/3 cup chopped parsley
• 2 cups Sun Gold or other bite-sized tomatoes, left whole
list end

1. Bring a pot of water to boil for the spaghetti. When it boils, add plenty of salt and the pasta, then cook until al dente.

2. Heat the oil in a wide, deep pan such as a Dutch oven. Add the peppers and onion and cook over high heat, tossing them about the pan to sear them. After
4 or 5 minutes, add the garlic, pour in the wine, and deglaze the pan, scraping up the pan juices. Lower the heat to medium and add the olives, capers,
half the parsley, and a scoop of water from the pasta pot. Season with salt and plenty of pepper. Add the little tomatoes, simmer for a minute, then turn
off the heat.

3. When the spaghetti is done, drain, then toss it with olive oil to taste. Divide among warm serving bowls, spoon the peppers and tomatoes over each, garnish
with the remaining parsley, and serve.

LYNNE'S TIPS
List of 4 items
• One of the great tiny tomatoes you might find now is the Red Currant. They're the size of a pregnant pea and are pure Beethoven's Fifth on your tongue.
Translate that to high sweet, high acid, which in my book is what a tomato is all about.
• You want good imported black olives for this dish. Greek Kalamatas and French Nicoise are available in most supermarkets. At specialty delis look for
Italian Gaetas and dry-cured, meaty, black Moroccan olives. If possible, taste before buying, and always count to ten after swallowing. That aftertaste
tells all.
• Capers are the flower buds of the Capparis sicula bush that grows wild throughout the Mediterranean. They give depth and an intriguing piquancy to a dish.
The smallest ones, most commonly available in supermarkets, are called nonpareils and come packed in vinegar brine in small jars. If you can find the larger
ones in coarse salt, they are packed with character. Rinse well before using. Capers never die. If stored in a sealed container in a cool dark place they'll
keep up to a year.
• Cheese wouldn't hurt this dish, especially if it's Parmigiano Reggiano. You deserve it.
