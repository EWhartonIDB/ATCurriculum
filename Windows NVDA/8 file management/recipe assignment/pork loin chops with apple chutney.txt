If you have time and can plan ahead, we recommend brining the pork—as long as you are buying unenhanced pork—as it will further enhance its flavor and texture.

Pork
List of 3 items
• 4 boneless loin chips, 3/4-inch thick (6 to 7 ounces each), brined if desired
• Salt and ground black pepper
• 1 tablespoon vegetable oil
list end

Sauce
List of 9 items
• 2 medium Granny Smith apples, peeled, cored, and cut into 1/2-inch dice
• 1 small onion, chopped fine
• Salt
• 1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger
• 1/4 teaspoon ground allspice
• 1/8 teaspoon cayenne
• 1 cup apple cider
• 1/4 cup packed light brown sugar
• Ground black pepper
list end

1. For the Pork: Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels, then season with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat until
just smoking. Lay the chops in the skillet and cook until light brown, about 3 minutes. Flip the chops over, reduce the heat to medium, and continue to
cook until the centers of the chops register 135 degrees on an instant-read thermometer, 5 to 10 minutes.

2. Transfer the chops to a plate, cover with foil, and let them rest until the centers reach an internal temperature of 145 to 150 degrees, 5 to 10 minutes.

3. For the Sauce: Add the apples, onion, and 1/4 teaspoon salt to the oil left in the skillet, return to medium-low heat, and cook, covered, until the onion
has softened, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the ginger, allspice, and cayenne and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the cider and sugar, scraping
up the browned bits. Bring to a simmer and cook until the cider is reduced and slightly thickened, about 4 minutes.

4. Pour any accumulated pork juices into the simmering sauce. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Spoon the sauce over the pork before serving.

LYNNE'S TIPS
List of 3 items
• Check the label on your pork chops for "enhancement," a euphemism for pork pumped with water and other things to get around the fact that it is so lean
it will cook to dry as a bone. Rather than paying for liquid (and ingredients you may not want to eat), either brine your own chops for an hour in salt
water, or buy chops with fine, but plentiful, marbling.

• Invest in an instant-reading thermometer if you don't have one. It is a kitchen essential. With it you get total control when cooking meats.

• Freeze unused fresh ginger root by peeling it, then sealing in a zip-top plastic freezer bag.

THOUGHTS FROM LYNNE

Brining ensures flavor packed, juicy, tender meat. When time allows, brine pork in the refrigerator in a solution of 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 3 tablespoons
salt and 4 cups water. Make sure the meat is completely submerged in the brine. If necessary, weight the meat down by placing a can of tomatoes or similar
heavy object on top of a plate or saucer set directly on top of the meat. Refrigerate for about an hour. Rinse and pat the meat dry before cooking.
