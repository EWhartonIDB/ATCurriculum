"Bensone always stains the tablecloth," declares an old Modena saying. Dunking the crumbling cake in glasses of sweet wine is a favorite way of eating Bensone.
The cake breaks up in the wine and is eaten with a spoon.

Simple ingredients and even simpler technique create the S-shaped cake. Its crust is craggy, and the melting sugar on top looks like molten crystal. Bensone
is never too sweet. It looks and tastes homemade - like a sweet, slightly crumbly biscuit.

Working Ahead: The cake is best eaten within several hours of baking. It will keep, tightly wrapped, at room temperature 2 days.

Preheat the oven to 350°. Grease a large baking sheet with the 1 tablespoon butter. Set a rack in the center of the oven. Put all the dry ingredients (except
the pearl sugar) in a large, shallow bowl. Blend with fingertips or a fork until the mixture resembles coarse meal.

Make a well in the middle of the mixture, and add all the liquids. Stir with a fork to blend. Gradually work in the dry ingredients, using a tossing motion
rather than stirring. Thoroughly moisten the dough. It should be lumpy, sticky, and moist. Do not beat or it will toughen.

Turn out dough on a floured surface. Flour your hands. Pat and nudge dough into a long flattened cylinder 3 to 4 inches wide, and about 1 inch thick. Twist
it into an S-shape. Set on baking sheet, sprinkle with pearl sugar, and bake 25 minutes. Lower heat to 250° and bake another 25 minutes, or until a tester
inserted in the center comes out clean. Transfer the Bensone to a rack. Cut it into 1/2-inch-thick slices to serve.
