<h2><a name=careandfeeding></a>The Care And Feeding Of Readers</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Peggy Pinder</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: One of the most valuable professional skills a blind person can acquire
and use effectively is managing readers. The ability to recruit, hire,
supervise, and fire people providing this service is vital to virtually every
blind person who hopes to succeed in school or employment. Recognizing this
fact, the planners of the 1993 National Association of Blind Students
Mid-Winter Conference asked Peggy Pinder (Second Vice President of the
National<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Federation of the Blind,
President of the NFB of Iowa, and an attorney in private practice) to pass on
advice and opinions drawn from her experience during a number of years of
working with readers to absorb huge amounts of information. It may surprise
you, but it is sound and practical advice for those who must get the most out
of every hour of reader time. Here is what she had to say<i style='mso-bidi-font-style:
normal'>:<o:p></o:p></i></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
have been asked this afternoon to speak about what I have called in my own mind
&quot;the care and feeding of readers.&quot; It is an important topic for all
blind people. I'll begin by defining accurately what we are talking about when
we say that we as blind people are hiring a reader. We are not hiring someone
to read. If that's what you think you are doing when you acquire a reader, then
I think you are starting with the wrong premise. In fact, you are attempting to
procure a method of acquiring information, how and when you want it. So the
commodity you want is information in the package you define. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
of my remarks today will be directed toward the paid relationship because that
is the ideal one. Someday you will be paying readers in connection with your
job, and you should get practice doing the same thing while you are still a
student. The vocational rehabilitation agency in your state should cover the
cost of your readers while you are a student. When you hire this
information-acquisition tool, you are clearly in need of something. In the
contracted relationship you establish, the other party (the reader) also needs
something. Your first job is to figure out what that is. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
you can say, &quot;I am the blind person, and I want information,&quot; and the
other person says, &quot;I am the reader, and I want money,&quot; the matter is
very clear and tidy. It is possible to establish the contract with some other
permutation if you wish, but this one is ideal, because it gives you what you
most want-- control. When you go into a reader relationship, you must
explicitly and implicitly establish that you are in control. Failing to do so
is the biggest single mistake that people make in handling readers. They allow
themselves to be convinced that the reader's feelings and needs and desires are
the important ones in the relationship. If my reader wants to go to the
bathroom, of course I'm going to let her go. I believe that it is important to
be courteous to and considerate of people with whom you are interacting, but
the reader does not make the determination about when and where and how fast
and how long and what; you do. And if you don't go into a reader relationship
with that firmly in mind, saying it explicitly and conducting yourself as
though you believe it, you will let the reader determine the most valuable
thing in the relationship--how much you are going to get out of it.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>This is true not only because you need a
specified quantity of information packaged at a given rate, but because you
must also learn how to hire, supervise, and fire readers. In college you can
make all the mistakes and learn the techniques in a relatively painless
situation. If you master all this by the time you get out into the working
world, you will have a leg up on both your blind and sighted competition. The
first advantage is that you will know how to get information. You will never be
placed in a situation in which you can't get the data you need. Sometimes
information is difficult or impossible to scan using today's technology. Most
of the material I deal with, for example, can't be scanned. It's handwritten,
and there's so much of it that I need to look at bits here and there. So the
only efficient way to access it is through human readers. For you as for me,
most of the material you will deal with for the rest of your life is likely to
require live readers, not computers. A lot of technological development will
have to take place over a number of years before this situation is likely to
change much. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
you need to learn how to interact with readers&#8212;find them, train them, and
get rid of them. But you also have to learn that you can do it--not the
Disabled Student Services Office, not Mom and Dad, not the itinerant teacher,
not your roommate, not your boyfriend or girlfriend--nobody but you directs
this very important part of your life: the management and acquisition of the
information you need! If you come out of your degree program having mastered
this skill, you are set for life with one of the most important techniques you
will ever learn. Aside from the confidence you will acquire by knowing that, if
you lose one reader, you can find two more, you will also be a skilled
middle-manager. Your sighted contemporaries don't have to learn to manage their
own time and that of others in determining how and when they are going to
study. They pick up a book and begin to read. You have learned to deal with
scheduling and control issues. If you have mastered the supervision of readers
and are confident in your ability to do so, you can justify putting on your
resume that you have middle-management skills. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
the topic of obtaining readers comes up, most people don't even talk about the
things I've been saying here. They say, &quot;I can't get readers.&quot;
Finding the readers you need is a full-time job until it is done. Every time
you lose one, getting the replacement becomes a full-time job again. When I was
in college, I got readers by putting up notices on all the dormitory bulletin
boards. By the time I got them all up, I usually had more readers than I
needed. When I went into the working world, I didn't have bulletin boards
anymore, so I put ads in the newspaper. This method also yielded me more
readers than I could ever use because with both techniques I swept so widely
that I got plenty of opportunities to pick and choose among the candidates
myself. I can absolutely guarantee you that, if you place a classified ad in
the newspaper, you will have to put an answering machine on your phone line to
notify people that you have already filled the position. People are out there
looking for jobs or hoping to earn a little extra money. You want to find those
people. Don't ever make the mistake of under-advertising for a reader. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Personally,
I would never take a list from a disabled students services office or anywhere
else. I want my readers to know that I am the one who found them, that I
outline the job, and that I am the one with whom they have to deal. Not only is
it easier to control the situation if the reader needs the cash, but it is a
lot easier if he or she is your age or younger. I don't find it easy to control
readers older than I, and I never have. I'm sure that is a pretty common
phenomenon. There are undoubtedly glorious exceptions, but probably not many,
particularly since younger people tend to be the ones who need the most
money.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
you can tell, I have never had trouble finding candidates for my reading jobs.
I begin by telling them what I want, and I assess their reactions to what I
have said. I usually give readers a test; I hand them something to read. Almost
no one does a good job of reading that first time. I am more interested in
assessing their reactions to being given the book, to being told to stop and go
to another page. I am assessing their basic reactions to the constraints of the
reading discipline, their interest in the money, and their responses to the
little speech I make them. I have developed it over the years, and it covers
the things that most people are daunted by and the errors that most people make
when they read to a blind person. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
tell them that I am not looking for someone to give me a dramatic reading; if I
want that, I'll buy a ticket to a play. I do not want people to worry about
their inflection. In fact, the best readers I have ever had are those who read
in almost a monotone, because that is the fastest way for the human body to
emit information. It is true that a good speaker of English automatically
inflects at punctuation. You can't stop yourself from doing it a little. I tell
readers not to worry about making sure to read expressively. Don't give me
drama; give me data, as fast as you can get it out. My fastest readers have
learned that they can read almost without moving their lips. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
often cite the example of the guy I had as a reader when I was a prosecutor.
When he was reading to me, people would come to the door and stand there
laughing. They would say to me, &quot;You can't understand him,&quot; and to
him, &quot;You're not even reading.&quot; I just shut the door because he and I
were perfectly happy; he was reading as fast as he could, and I was listening
as fast as I could, and it suited both of us. He also had learned--as have all
my best readers--what I tell all of them to learn: the technique of reading
without having a clue about what they are saying. I tell readers this because,
if they know that it is a good idea, they will develop the technique faster,
and if I don't tell them, it will upset them when it happens. I also tell my
readers that it is impossible for them to read too fast for me. When I read a
recorded book, I automatically double the playback rate. If you can't
understand books at a very fast speed, you should practice doing so, because it
is an invaluable skill for students or working people who have lots of material
to get through.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
also tell readers that I have heard every English word and many foreign ones as
well pronounced in every possible way. I don't care if they don't know how to
say the word correctly. If it occurs frequently, I'll tell the reader how to
pronounce it because the mispronunciation will irritate both of us. But by and
large I really don't care how they pronounce the word if they will just get it
out. If they are really too afraid to take a stab at it, I tell them to spell
it and go on.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With that little
speech I pretty well get very good, very efficient reading right from the start
because I have touched on everything readers are most afraid of. And I have
told them what my parameters are. Later on, if I have to say that a passage is
too dense for them to take at speed, they can slow down. It is much harder to
try to speed up a reader who has been used to reading for you at a slow speed.
Set your readers at a fast rate first, and slow them down when you need to. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
have a few comments about specialized reading. I will take just about anybody
as a reader, if he or she can speak the language. I would say that if you are
taking a foreign language course, you do need a reader with that specialized
knowledge. But in chemistry, mathematics, or symbolic logic, for example, you can
train almost any accurate reader who shows up on time to deal with the special
symbols. Yes, there is specialized knowledge involved in reading such subjects,
but don't assume that you can't do the teaching. After all, you need to know
what those symbols mean. If you don't, you have to get the first reader you
have scheduled for the course to take the time to describe them to you. You
cannot afford to hire readers who already know the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>symbols and take the attitude that you don't need to
know what they look like because the reader will take care of that part. Your
response to that attitude must be, &quot;No, you won't. I'm paying you to
provide me with the information I want, and that includes the
symbols.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Don't ever
fall into the trap of hiring a knowledgeable reader in a particular subject who
then becomes your tutor as part of the reading responsibility. You are not
hiring for that function. If you need a tutor, hire one. Your reader must
always know that you are in charge: When I say skim, you skim; when I say skip,
you skip. Don't put up with pauses or with comments like &quot;Wait, this looks
interesting.&quot; The other thing you have to make clear is that you expect
your readers to read everything on the page unless you tell them to omit it. I
am certain that, if you lay down the guidelines I have just described, you will
have competent readers.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is your job to schedule your readers in such a way that you will always be able
to get the assignments done. This may mean that you will have to find some
readers who can be flexible and some who can allow you to increase the time on
short notice. You may need to establish the policy with some readers that you
can cancel an appointment at short notice. You should structure things in such
a way that, when you finish a class, you can sit down and use the time
following with a reader. You don't want to have to go to an employer someday
and admit that &quot;my reader was sick yesterday, so I lost that
hundred-thousand-dollar contract because I wasn't able to read the material.&quot;
In other words, part of mastering this management skill is learning to do
multi-layered scheduling with the option to cancel and scheduling sufficient
reader time with the option to increase the hours if necessary. You never want
to admit to a professor that you couldn't complete an assignment because you
didn't have a reader. That is not a valid excuse.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
a reader is not working out for whatever reason, you will know it right away.
Remember, you are not locked into keeping him or her; let such readers go.
Never mind that you like the person; fire him anyway. You can go out and have
beers with him, marry him, or do anything else you want with him, but don't
keep him as a reader! You have no responsibility to be nice to that person;
your job is to get information out of him. If you want to socialize, do it in
some other context, but do not ever fall into the trap of thinking that you
have to keep a reader because his or her feelings would be hurt if you severed
the reading relationship. Your job is to get rid of poor readers and do it in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a civil and humane enough way that you can keep them
as friends if that's what you want to do. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
that I have said is true in some sense of volunteer readers as well, but the
difference is that they are being paid in a form that is not the coin of the
realm. Long-term volunteer readers are either motivated by an impulse to be
nice to a blind person or fulfilling some requirement imposed by a church or
social organization. Either way, they are not responding to you and the money
you control. If you are absolutely compelled to use volunteer readers, you must
figure out what their motivation is and find a way to turn it toward yourself
in order to establish personal commitment and response to you. It is still true
that everything I have said about paid readers is also necessary in your
relationship with a volunteer reader. Volunteers must read everything on the
page, respond to your directions, and get the words out as fast as possible.
And, if they don't, you have to fire them too. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
you have what I know about readers and the way to establish a good
working-relationship with them, delivered as quickly and concisely as I know
how to say it. </p>

<h2>Of Readers, Drivers, and Responsibility</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>by Peggy Pinder Elliott and Barbara Cheadle</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: The following article is reprinted from the Fall, 1994, issue of
Future Reflections, the magazine of the National Organization of Parents of
Blind Children, a Division of the National Federation of the Blind. It begins
with Barbara Cheadle's editorial note. The discussion is constructive and
timely for parents of blind children as well as for blind people of all ages.
Here it is:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
of the presentations given at the daylong seminar for parents of blind children
at the 1994 NFB National Convention was entitled &quot;Readers and Drivers: The
Other Alternative Techniques of Blindness.&quot; For this presentation Peggy
Elliott and I teamed up for a lively discussion from two viewpoints: the blind
person who uses readers and drivers and the sighted person who provides</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the service. (Peggy is a blind attorney, the Second
Vice President of the National Federation of the Blind, and the President of
the NFB of Iowa. I am the editor of Future Reflections, President of the
National Organization of Parents of Blind Children, and the sighted parent of a
sixteen-year-old blind son.) However, everyone quickly discovered these
differences were only superficial. Since both speakers operated using the same
philosophy of blindness, we arrived quite</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>naturally at complementary conclusions about what
parents and blind kids need most to know about these other alternative
techniques.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
following article is an expansion and refinement of the discussion held at the
parents' seminar. After looking at the transcript, both of us wanted to flesh
out several ideas we had only had time to mention in passing at the seminar. We
also agreed upon a slightly different title. Here, then, is what Peggy</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Elliott and I have to say about readers, drivers,
and responsibility:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center'>Peggy Pinder
Elliott</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
get to talk today specifically about readers and drivers. But these are really
only subparts of a much more general topic, alternative techniques. I've heard
some of today's session already, and lots of people have used the term
&quot;alternative techniques.&quot; Let me give you an example which I think
will give</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>more body to this concept and will help you better
understand my comments today about how readers and drivers function (or should
function) for blind people.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I talk to school children about blindness, as I often do, I tell them I'm going
to talk about alternative techniques such as Braille. Of course, they think
this is interesting. I tell them that Braille's the same as print; they are
alternatives to each other. When you're talking with second-, third-, or even</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>fourth-graders, this concept is a bit of a reach; so
I use an example. Here's what I say. I ask the children if their moms have a
place in the kitchen where they keep cookies. The kids usually giggle and say,
&quot;Yeah.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Do
you know where that is?&quot; I ask. Yes, they know where Mom keeps the
cookies. Then I ask them if Mom can reach the cookies easily just by standing
on the floor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
say, &quot;Oh, yeah, of course. She can reach them just</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>standing on the floor.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
ask, &quot;Can you reach the cookies standing on the floor?&quot;<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;No!,
uh uh. We're not supposed to get into the cookies.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Do
you know a way, when Mom's not in the kitchen, that you can get to those
cookies?&quot; They always giggle and give me various methods (usually
involving counters and stools) that they have figured out for getting to the
cookies. So I say, &quot;Now, see, your mom's taller than you, so she can reach
the cookies by standing on the floor. But you can still reach the cookies by
using an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>`alternative technique.' The point is, you get the
cookies, right?&quot; Anyway, kids always like this subject, so I have found it
to be a good way of explaining about alternative techniques. What I stress to
the kids is that it isn't really important how you do it (get the cookies); the
important thing is to get it done.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
parents of blind children you need to be concerned with making sure that your
children learn techniques and approaches which they can use throughout their
lives so they can get it done--whatever &quot;it&quot; is. Today, I'm going to
help you with this job. I'm going to give you some pointers on what to teach
your</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>child about using readers and drivers. First I'm
going to talk about what we--blind adults--do with readers and drivers. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
all know about the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). We all know about the
Braille literacy laws we have gotten passed in twenty-five states. We know
there are lots of sources of reading material in alternative media (such as
Braille and tapes) used by the blind. But, despite all this, I will tell you
flat</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>out that it is not possible for all printed or
written material ever to be simultaneously available in an alternative medium
accessible to the blind. It is just not going to happen. For example, in my own
practice (I'm a lawyer) I get a lot of stuff in handwriting. This type of
material will not be readily</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>accessible in my lifetime or even the lifetime of
your children in any way other than through the use of a reader.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
reader, by the way, is a sighted person who conveys to the blind individual the
print or pictorial information on a piece of paper. Every blind person needs to
be able to use readers as one way of getting information. This is true for
students in college, and it's true for blind people in most any job. Therefore,
it's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>important to keep in mind that readers are going to
be a part of any blind person's life. I remind college students of this all the
time. I was talking just the other day to someone who was complaining about not
getting a book in time for the beginning of a class. (It happened to be a
college student, but it could have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>been a high school student.) I said that in a job
the employer is not responsible for such details; the blind person is. One
can't walk into the employer's office and say, &quot;You have to provide me
with this or that.&quot; The blind employee has to be able to walk into that
office and say to the employer, &quot;Tell me what I can do</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for you and by when you need it done.&quot; The use
of readers gives blind people the flexibility needed to take on this
responsibility. So understanding readers and learning how to use them are
important techniques for parents to help their children learn to use.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Readers,
in my view, are (as I once said to the consternation of some of my readers)
information-acquisition tools. Some readers find this description a bit cold. I
do not intend to be cold, but information acquisition is my goal when I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>use a reader--not friendship or companionship or
anything else. The fact that the information is acquired through the use of
another human being instead of through Braille, a tape recorder, or some other
tool or device in no way changes the fact that I am using an alternative to get
information others would get with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>their eyes. I think it's important for everyone
concerned to understand that the sighted reader is first and foremost an
information-acquisition tool for a blind person.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
blind adults pay for readers. You simply cannot get readers on a regular basis
in college, on the job, or even for personal affairs if you don't pay them.
This makes reading an employer/employee relationship. The reading is then a
service bought and paid for, not a favor to the blind person. The blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>person needs to understand this and teach it to the
reader. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City>
is a service that's being provided. It's something I need. It's something for
which I'm willing to pay. It is not a favor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
most important and fundamental responsibility of the blind person in a reader
relationship is to be in charge and to make all the decisions about what is
read. This is easy to say but sometimes hard to implement. Sighted people who
are new readers often want to tell the blind person what they think needs</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to be read, not what the blind person really wants
to know but what the sighted person finds of interest. Therefore, when using an
information-acquisition tool that happens to be human, the blind person has to
be very clear that he or she is the one making the decisions and furthermore
needs to convey this politely and firmly to the reader. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was a prosecutor when I first came out of law school. Most of the material that
came across my desk had been generated that day. There was no way to get at
that material without having a sighted reader under my direction to read to me
what I needed to know. On the other hand, I would never have gotten anything
else done if I had not known when to tell the reader to stop reading.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>People hand you a lot of material these days that
you don't need to read. Blind people must know how to acquire and analyze
material quickly, regardless of whether the information is accessed through
their own hands (Braille) or through another person (a reader).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first thing--and
this is very important--that blind children need to learn is that using readers
is okay. It is one of the many appropriate alternative techniques they will be
using throughout life. Using Braille is okay. Using tapes is okay. Using
readers is okay. A high school principal came to me once in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>consternation. She said that, because she couldn't
get a certain book in Braille for a blind student on time, the student had been
excused from doing a book report. I landed on that principal with both feet! I
said, &quot;Why did the student get out of doing the book report? Don't you
provide readers as an alternative when the book isn't available? Have you ever
given the student experience in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>using a reader?&quot; The principal was surprised.
She had never thought about that student's need to learn how to use readers.
She didn't think of readers as an appropriate alternative technique. Well, they
are. Obviously, the child first needs to know how to read and write--to be
literate. But once that stage is achieved and the child has solid Braille
skills, the next stage includes using tapes and readers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How can you teach your
child to use readers? For one thing, you can build it into the IEP
(Individualized Education Program) when the child gets older (junior high or
middle school). Determine in advance that certain material in certain classes
will be read with readers. Research papers using reference material and other
books from the library are good projects for reader use. Get the student
involved in this procedure. He or she needs to play an active part in all the
decisions regarding reader use. Parents, the student's Braille teacher, or
blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>adult role models can then conduct some reader
training sessions with the student. Use a book the student has used and with
which he or she is familiar. Ask the student to decide what should be read;
then teach the youngster how to give oral instruction to move a reader through
the printed material. You may even want to do a role reversal. Have the student
be the reader with his or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>her Braille text, and you do the directing. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
important thing to remember is not to help the student too much. In fact, you
may want to make a distinction between your teacher/reader role and your
reader-only role. As a teacher/reader you will interrupt and make<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>suggestions as your child practices
directing you in reading. You may also discuss the layout and content of the
book and the illustrations, etc. But in your role as a reader you will only
read what you are directed to read, and you will not make comments or judgments
about what you are asked to read or not read. Nor will you give information
from the material which you have not been asked to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>provide (descriptions of pictures or illustrations
or information about appendices, bibliographies, etc.) </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
can be extremely difficult to do, but if the student does not ask you to read
something, keep your mouth shut. Do not read anything except what you have been
directed to read. Conversely, if the student asks you to read material you
think is unnecessary, don't make any comments or judgments; just read. The</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>student must learn to be in charge and to accept the
consequences of decisions, including mistakes. Besides, you will find even in
the early stages that your child is often right and you are wrong. Even if you
are very familiar with the subject matter, the student knows more about the class,
the teacher, and the teacher's expectations than you do. Remember, in this
situation you are a reader--not a tutor, not a parent, not a teacher, not a
mentor, not a friend, but a reader only. Be sure that others who read for your
child understand this. As the parent you may have to be aggressive in insisting
that those who read for your child follow these rules.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
is especially true since it is more common for blind children and youth to have
volunteer readers as opposed to paid ones. Also readers are more likely at this
stage to be selected by someone other than the student--parents, teachers, etc.
These circumstances combined with the youth and inexperience of the student
tend to blur the issue of who is in control, who is making the decisions. The
primary motivation of those who are paid for a service is clear--money. The
connection between keeping their job and following the rules laid down by the
student is also clear. The motivation for volunteers is somewhat</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>different. They want to help a blind person; maybe
they are even friends with the student. Such volunteers tend to think of
themselves more as partners than as employees receiving instructions. This
situation requires more delicacy and tact if</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the blind student is to remain in control but still
keep a reader happy and motivated to continue reading.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If,
however, a reader is a paid employee of the school, such as a teacher's aide,
the student may still have a problem. Because the child is young and is a
student, both reader and student may assume that the reader is automatically in
charge by virtue of age and status as a school employee. If a reader under
these circumstances refuses to follow the directions of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>student, the parent or Braille teacher or both must
insist that the reader be replaced with someone who will cooperate. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Usually
members of one's own family are a student's first readers. This can work well
as long as the principle is established and followed that the student is in
charge of the reading. However, if siblings are required to read, there need to
be trade-offs. Siblings need to feel that they get something out of this
arrangement too. Maybe they will be paid (if so, then the blind student needs
an equal opportunity to do work for which there is pay), or maybe an exchange
of services can be made between the blind student and sighted sibling. For
example, one student allowed his older sibling to read his taped books from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Library for the Blind in exchange for reading
services. Whatever the circumstances, the objective is always the same: for the
blind students to get the printed information they want&#8212;not what someone
else thinks they should have.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
regard to drivers the framework of analysis is essentially the same. I can repeat
exactly what I said with this slight change: the objective is not to get
information, of course, but to get somewhere. Because blind children will not</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>become drivers when they grow up, they must
integrate into their life pattern a plan for other people to drive them. They
will not have the option of picking up the keys and jumping into the car
whenever they need to go somewhere. This will be irritating and a nuisance, but
let me tell you something; it's okay. There are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>appropriate alternatives, and they do work. It
helps, though, if you understand the options, if you train your kids to know
how to handle the alternatives, and if you let them know that these
alternatives are okay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
you must remember that, if you are using paid drivers, they are not doing you a
favor. Drivers are supposed to do what you tell them to do and be where you say
you want them when you want them. You have to learn to plan ahead when you're
dealing with drivers. If you have to get to the airport, you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>should avoid calling someone at the last minute in
the hope that they will do you a favor and get you there on time. You've got to
be sure that your drivers will show up when you need them. Therefore, you must
approach using a driver as a service which you plan and direct and for which
you are willing to pay.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two major issues
involved in planning the use of drivers are scheduling and routing. Since
scheduling is something parents work on with all kids, the scheduling of driver
service need not be approached any differently; the same principles apply. But
what about routing? A blind student has planned ahead and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>arranged for driver service to an event. The driver
arrives; the student gets into the car; then what? Who sets the itinerary? Who
decides the route to and from the destination? Well, when I'm in the car and
have hired the driver, I set the itinerary, and I decide the route. How do I
know the route? If I have never been</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to the place before, I get directions in advance
just as anyone else would do. This surprises many people because the tendency
is for the sighted person to take responsibility for this task. Sighted people
don't expect a blind person to be aware of surroundings or capable of giving
directions. And sadly many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind people can't because they never learned to do
so or even realized that it was possible.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parents
can play an active role in preparing blind youth to learn driving routes and
how to give directions to drivers. One method I would recommend very strongly
is emulating a driver. Try, for example, a trip to the supermarket. Get into
the car with your youngster, get behind the wheel, then say &quot;Okay, where
do we go?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now
your kid might try to be smart and say &quot;To the supermarket,&quot; but
don't buy it. Demand specific instructions for every turn. When you back out of
the driveway, do you turn right or left? (Which raises another interesting
travel problem for your child: what do right and left mean when you're going in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reverse as opposed to going forward in a vehicle?).
How many blocks do you travel before you turn? Which direction do you turn? Is
there a light or a stop sign at the turn? Are there any landmarks--buildings,
signs, etc.--to which the driver should be alert? It may take you a couple of
hours the first time you try</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>this, but there's no better way for your kid to
learn. So you might as well not plan to buy milk that first time. You may not
even get there the first time you try this, but that's okay. The best thing
parents can do for their children is give them time so they will have opportunities
such as this to learn by doing. They need time and encouragement to do things
on their own, to make mistakes and learn from them. And they need to know from
you that this is an okay way to learn. Drivers, like readers, will tend
unconsciously to take over. Your child needs to have the training and
confidence to resist this impulse and take charge of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>situation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
you've completed this exercise, sit down and talk to your child about concepts
he or she may have missed. What is a block? How do streets intersect? What is
the difference between parallel and perpendicular traffic? Can he or she use
the cardinal directions: east, west, north, and south? What about</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>describing various traffic patterns: one-way
streets, multiple lanes, right turns on red, left-turn-only lanes, four-way
stop signs, speed limits, and so forth? These concepts aren't necessarily hard
to learn, nor should their mastery be restricted</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to mobility class. Have your kid sit up front with
you when you drive and talk about these traffic patterns as you encounter them.
Talk out loud about what you see when you drive.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
about maps? Does your child know how to use them? Kids need to have and use
maps. They don't always have to be permanent works of art. You can use table
utensils and napkins to make simple maps which show how streets intersect to
make blocks. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
your kid has some success in directing you as a driver, branch out to other
family members, relatives, friends, and volunteers. Give your kids the chance
to learn how to direct a lot of different people as drivers. When they become
adults and are finally out on their own, they'll be able to get where they</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>want to go because you gave them many opportunities
to learn and practice these skills when they were young. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
experiences in driving and reading have been as a volunteer within the National
Federation of the Blind. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City>
and driving have been a part of what I have contributed to the organization. In
fact, I have never been a paid driver or reader for anyone. I first joined the
NFB as a member of the local</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>chapter in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Omaha</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Nebraska</st1:State></st1:place>. I was sighted, my
husband was sighted, and we owned a twelve-passenger van. At the time it made
sense that driving could be one of our contributions to the chapter. (Please
note that I said &quot;could&quot; not &quot;should&quot; be driving. The fact
that people are sighted and drive does not mean</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that this is automatically the contribution they
should make as members of the NFB. Although I still drive occasionally for
local chapter functions, it is no longer one of my primary contributions to the
affiliate.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
of my earliest experiences in driving under the direction of a blind colleague
was with a fellow named Jerry Eckery. I recall that the first time I drove
Jerry someplace I did not know where we were going, and he gave directions. He
was excellent. He did everything Peggy was telling you that you should teach
your child to do when in charge of a driver. He was in control. He knew where
he was going and was able to give instructions and describe landmarks that a
sighted driver could follow. We would make a turn, and he would say, &quot;You
should be passing an Exxon station to your left.&quot; Sure enough, there it
was. This was a route he had never walked. He had no reason to know about that
Exxon station except that he knew it would be helpful to the sighted drivers he
would be directing. I truly appreciated and learned a lot from Jerry. As a
driver, volunteer</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>or paid, it certainly made my job a lot easier to be
able to sit back and follow directions. That's what I did when I was Jerry's
driver.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
member of our chapter whom my husband and I frequently drove to meetings was an
elderly woman who had grown up as a blind child in a very protected and
sheltered environment. She didn't have much money, and she didn't get out much.
She didn't have Jerry's extensive knowledge of the city,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>but she did know her own street and could give
others information about her area. She did something else which I truly came to
appreciate. She knew that I was a member of the NFB chapter and that I
considered driving my contribution. Nevertheless, she did not take my driving
for granted. She always thanked me for the ride. From time to time she offered
me money (which I always</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>refused) or a trinket or toy for my children (which
I would accept). She did not have Jerry's knowledge, independence, and
resources, but she had dignity, she was courteous, and she did not expect
others to do for her what she could do--however small it was--for herself. That
attitude was evident in the way she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>treated me as a driver.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
said that, let me shift gears, so to speak, and talk to you about some of my
pet peeves as a driver. When I'm done, Peggy will get a shot at the same topic.
I think that one of my top pet peeves is driving for someone who is
consistently unable to give me directions or tell me about landmarks: who, in
short, is never able to tell me anything more than the address of our</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>destination. I am not annoyed at the individual, for
I know that this is merely a matter of ignorance and lack of skills. These
people, as blind children or as newly blinded adults, never had the opportunity
to learn how to take responsibility for giving directions to others and
furthermore never knew that this was possible. Rather I am annoyed and angry at
the real culprits: parents who overprotected their children, rehabilitation
systems which custodialize instead of promoting independence, and the general
cultural environment which continues to promote an image of the blind as
helpless and dependent. You can avoid this problem with your children by
teaching them these skills and especially conveying to them that it is their
responsibility to know how to get to where they want to go and how to direct
those who are driving them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
do you do that? Here is one idea. We used to play an orientation game when we
were traveling in our vehicle with our three children (one of whom is blind).
My husband would say, &quot;If I were to get in the car, pull out of the </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>riveway, turn left, go two blocks, cross the street
at the light, proceed to the next</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>light and make a left, then stop about halfway down
the block, where am I?&quot; The children would guess the answer. Then one of
them would have a turn to describe a route--putting in all turns, landmarks,
etc. as appropriate--and the rest of us in the car would guess the answer. This
was a great game, not just for our</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind son, but for everyone in the family. You can
think of other mobility or orientation games to play too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
when I'm in a vehicle as a driver or as a passenger, I naturally talk a lot
about landmarks. I call everyone's attention to a new billboard, a new
four-way-stop sign, the architectural style of buildings we pass, and so forth.
This natural tendency on my part was helpful especially to our blind son. He
began to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>learn about the things in the surrounding
environment that sighted drivers use as important landmarks in getting about. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
ability to operate a car personally is, unquestionably, a great convenience in
our society. However, people pay a great deal for this convenience. It is
expensive to own and operate a vehicle--even a clunker or an economy
high-gas-mileage model. My other pet peeve is with people who assume that, not
only is driving your own car more convenient than alternative modes of
transportation, but it is also much cheaper. This just isn't so.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Years ago my husband (who was single at the time)
compared his yearly transportation expenses--personal and
job-related&#8212;with those of a blind colleague. Both of them worked for a
state agency in supervisory positions, doing pretty much the same type of job.
They were both bachelors, lived in the same city, and were in the same social
circle, so their personal social activities were equivalent. Out of curiosity
they sat down (they spent hours doing this) with all their tax information and
compared personal and business transportation expenses. My husband owned and
operated a travel-all van; his friend used all</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the available alternative transportation modes
available to him: public transportation, taxis, walking, and privately paid
drivers for both business and personal use (he was reimbursed for on-the-job
travel expenses at the same rate my husband and other sighted employees were
reimbursed for their travel expenses). The difference in expenses was no more
than $2.00. (Don't ask me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>which way it came down, Peggy. I don't remember.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
parents you are in a position to teach your child about the real costs of
owning and operating a vehicle. We teach our sighted children these things.
Many sighted sixteen-year-olds are required to work or save money to help pay
for the cost of their automobile insurance, the gas they use in the family car,
or the cost of their own vehicle. How many parents think to teach this
information to their blind teenagers? Do your blind teenagers know how much
their automobile insurance would cost if they drove? How about the up-front
purchase cost of a car. Do your blind teens know that most people go into debt
and spend years</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>making monthly payments on the cost of a vehicle?
What about maintenance and repair costs? Have your blind teenagers gone with
you to the auto shop to buy tires or to pay a $200 repair bill and pick up a
car, which has been in the shop for a week?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
information helps your teens in many ways. It gives them a better perspective
on and understanding of their own transportation costs now and when they become
independent adults. They will feel different about the monthly cost of bus
fare, taxi fare, and private driver's fees if they know what it costs the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>average sighted guy to drive a car. This knowledge
will also help them as adults to negotiate fees for private drivers
successfully and fairly. Many blind teens will grow up and eventually own cars,
which will be operated by sighted spouses, other family members (such as
sighted teenagers), or even hired drivers. But</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for some reason (perhaps our stereotyped notions
about blindness) we parents seldom think about the necessity of teaching our
blind children about the costs and problems of owning and operating a vehicle.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
knowledge will also help your children grow up to be effective and courteous
users of volunteer drivers. Even when they become financially independent
adults, there will always be occasions when the most convenient, or only
available, transportation is with a friend, a co-worker, a neighbor, or other
people willing to volunteer a ride. Should the driver be offered money for gas?
How much out of the way is it reasonable to ask the driver to go? Should you
arrange to do a favor in exchange for the ride or just remember to do something
special for the person sometime? Or, under the circumstances, is there a need
to do anything at all other than say &quot;Thanks?&quot; Every situation is
different, so there is no one right answer to these questions. However, the
more knowledge blind people have about the transportation time and costs to
sighted drivers, the better</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>able they will be to make decisions which keep
everyone&#8212;rider and driver--happy and feeling good about the situation. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
a volunteer driver I have been in all the situations described. When my
children were small, I sometimes exchanged favors with a blind friend who also
had small children. She would baby-sit for my children, and I would drive or
read for her. It was a legitimate exchange of favors, and we considered it an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>equal relationship. On other occasions, when driving
to a Federation meeting, for example, it might or might not be appropriate for
riders to share the expense. If the meeting was hours away, clear across the
state, sharing the costs made sense. If it was a local meeting for which I
incurred no significant extra expense either in time or mileage, it never
seemed right to accept more than a &quot;Thank you&quot; from riders.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
sum up, you can give your children a head start in avoiding these pet peeves if
you give them a good education now in how to be responsible for and skilled in
meeting their own transportation needs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I started
thinking about pet peeves I only came up with two, but they're pretty
all-encompassing. One involves the sighted, and one involves the blind.
Interestingly enough they are obverse sides of the same coin. My pet peeve
involving blind people is (and possibly I feel more strongly about this because
I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>am so aware that it doesn't need to be this way)
blind people who don't take responsibility. Responsibility for what? Well, for
anything! It starts when you're a kid. For example, in my family we had a whole
passel of kids; there were six of us. And at the dinner table, if you didn't
push your chair in when you got up</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>from the table, three or four of your brothers and
sisters were likely to wind up with bruised shins, and they would come and
pound on you because they had tripped over the chair you forgot to push in. In
my family pushing in your chair wasn't a matter of courtesy; it was a matter of
survival.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now
I ask you, how many blind kids do you suppose get up from the table and push in
their chairs? And how many don't push in their chairs? How many parents
consistently say, &quot;Son, come back here and push in your chair,&quot; and
how many do you suppose never say a word, but just push it in themselves? How
many blind kids get up from the table and leave while everybody else in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>family carries the dirty dishes into the kitchen?
How many of you require your sighted kids to help clear the table but never ask
your blind kid to do his or her part? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
blind adults who do not take responsibility were once blind children who were
never asked to carry the same weight as others. Furthermore, usually no one
even described to the child what others were doing. The blind child may not
know that other people push in their chairs. Eventually the kid will deduce</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>either that all chairs are on automatic rollers or
that someone else is pushing them in. But why not make it a point of
instruction and responsibility for the blind kid at the same age you would do
it for the sighted kid? It is simply a matter of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>courtesy for all of us to push in our chairs. Why
not make it a point of instruction that all family members--including the blind
child--will help with this or that task: making beds, vacuuming, collecting
laundry, folding laundry, etc.? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blind
children who do not get this instruction are the ones who grow up to become
those blind adults who do not know how to tell others where they live, who do
not know how to give instructions to a driver, who are not responsible enough
to schedule transportation ahead of time, and who do not have the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>courtesy to offer payment to a driver when
appropriate. To me responsibility and courtesy go hand in hand. I am afraid
that all too many blind children--and some blind adults too--have not been
taught or have forgotten the lessons of responsibility and courtesy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
lessons must be taught by you, the parents of blind children. It may sometimes
take a little longer to teach your blind child. The first time you tell your
kid to push in a chair, you may need to walk around behind him and put his hands
on the chair and show him how to push. So what? Even if you have to do</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>this a number of times, eventually he will learn to
push the chair in by himself. He will have learned a lesson in courtesy and
will have taken on a little bit more responsibility. This, in the end, lets him
hold his head higher because he is then a part of what's going on around him,
not a helpless bystander. And each</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>such experience makes the next task easier to learn.
</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
obverse of this pet peeve is, of course, the sighted person who assumes that
she knows what is good for a blind person and that it is her job to take care
of everything for the blind individual. You'd be surprised how many things are
simply done for us, to us, and around us that we may not ever know about unless
we are alert and know to anticipate the problem. Even then</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>we may only learn about what was done after it is
too late to do anything about it. Let me give you two examples of this pet
peeve.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was standing on a street corner one day. The light was red for travel in my
direction. A woman came up behind me, grabbed my arm--practically cutting off
the circulation, and said that she would take me across the street. I pointed
out to her that the light was red and that I was waiting for traffic to stop
and the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>light to change so that I could cross safely. She
dropped my arm in anger, said, &quot;Well, you think you know so much,&quot;
and walked away. I was quite capable of judging whether or not it was safe to
cross that street, and I wasn't about to go just because she said it was okay.
She was welcome to go if she wanted to, but I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wasn't going with her. In effect, she was trying to
take responsibility for me and then became irritable when I pointed out the
basic facts about red and green lights and furthermore insisted on taking
responsibility for myself. That really torched her. The attitude which prompts
this kind of behavior among sighted people toward the blind not only diminishes
the dignity of blind persons but diminishes the sighted as well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here's
another very recent example. This happened when my husband (who is quite tall
and also blind), my secretaries, and I were in line to board the airplane to
come to this convention. My sighted colleagues and I had walked through the
airplane door when, as my husband was about to walk through, the flight
attendant cried out, &quot;Watch his head!&quot; Well, we all spun around and
looked--for whatever good that did! She had good intentions, she was trying to
give him information, but she didn't know how to do it. She thought someone
else had to be responsible for him; someone else had to &quot;watch his
head&quot;--he couldn't do it himself. My husband's been tall a long time, and
he's gotten onto a few</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>planes in his life. He knows when and how to protect
his rather tall head.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
incidents are a continuing irritation to blind people. It is abrasive to our
dignity to have sighted people around us assume that they are responsible for
us and then proceed to do things and take actions which we could--and
should--be doing for ourselves. But as blind adults we must simply deal with
these situations. How do we do it? Well, at the personal day-to-day level we
hopefully bring to these incidents the right balance of courtesy, tact, and
firmness. We do not wish to be rude, but neither must we let ourselves be
pushovers and let others take responsibility for us. On a broader level this is
the very reason for the existence of the National Federation of the Blind:
public</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>education. The person who thinks he has to help me
across the street is likely to be the same person who will deny me a job. But I
know that what we do in the National Federation of the Blind has changed public
attitudes and will continue to change them. I know I am treated with greater
respect on the street and in the workplace than were our founders, like Dr.
Jacobus tenBroek, fifty years ago. Furthermore, I intend to do my part so that
your children will be able to say the same thing about my generation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
what role do you, the parents, play? Again, on the day-to-day, personal level
you need to teach your children to take responsibility for themselves. You need
to instill in them the confidence and skill to be tactful yet firm with
those--kindly as they may be--who will try to take it away from them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>You are their first sighted model. Yes, in the NFB
we talk a lot about blind models, and your child does need us. But they need
good sighted models too. And you are their first, and can be their best,
sighted model. What do you model for your child? Do you insist, in small ways
and large, that they take responsibility for themselves? Do you graciously back
down when your lesson takes, and they tell you firmly, &quot;Leave me alone. I
will do this myself&quot;? And at the broader level are you doing your part as
a member of the National Federation of the Blind to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>educate the sighted public about the capabilities of
the blind?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
I said, my pet peeves are pretty all-encompassing. But if you want your blind
child to grow up to be independent in all areas of life as an adult, including
the effective use of readers and drivers, I think you must honestly address the
issues we have raised here today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: The following essay first appeared in the Winter, 1997, Minnesota Bulletin,
a publication of the National Federation of the Blind of Minnesota. The Metro
Chapter conducted an essay contest in 1996, and this piece was the winner. Pat
Barrett is a long-time Federationist and a leader wherever he goes. Here is
what he says about the value of readers:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
use readers? When I was in college, I more or less made the decision not to use
them rather than considering the possibility of doing so. At the time I was
dating my wife Trudy, who is blind and used readers. She encouraged me to use
them too. Trudy knew how much time I was spending at the special resource room
at the library using the Visualtek machine to read books that had not yet been
recorded. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
was getting books from Recordings for the Blind. I knew Braille, but at that
time I felt I was too slow at reading it to apply it to college work. I told
myself that I had reading covered. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trudy
kept insisting I try readers. I finally relented. She gave me the name of one
of her readers who did well. The person did. I got the assignment read in less
time than I would have using the print enlarger, experienced no</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>eyestrain, and had time to take Trudy out--a heck of
a deal. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pride
prevented me from recognizing the real value of employing readers until years
later. All of us grow up with the formidable conviction that it is better to
see, even a little, than not to. Five senses are certainly better than</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>four. The strong emphasis placed on relying so much
on a partial sense of sight eclipsed my consideration of more efficient alternatives.
I regret to admit that this partial-and I know I speak for others of you out
there&#8212;has mentally put down totals for having no sight and depending on
readers. Puffed up with pride, we unwittingly blind ourselves to better ways of
doing our reading. The truth is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the totals had it covered all along.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ten
years after college I was working at an independent living center in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Idaho</st1:place></st1:State>. I had had two
long-term jobs before this one and had not used readers. But, working out
reasonable accommodations for that job, I requested readers</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in preference to a print enlarger. I cannot recall
what made me make that commitment. Perhaps it was having friends and role
models in the NFB who did their jobs successfully and efficiently using
readers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
enjoyed the flexibility and lack of eyestrain using a reader with 20/20 vision.
Depending upon what needed to be read, my assistant could read verbatim, scan,
or skip material. I have hired readers on the job ever since. I also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>apply synthesized speech, Braille, large print, and
the enlarging machine--only if a reader is not immediately available. Using
readers has helped me become more informed about the best alternative for a
given facet of the job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Enrolled
as a student at BLIND, Inc., in 1994, I realized that the python of pride had
not been pried sufficiently loose. Pam Iverson, my life skills teacher,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>urged me to complete the class goal to start using a
personal reader at home for mail and other print. My main concern was the
intrusion into my privacy. But like Trudy, Pam kept at me until I agreed. I can
honestly say now that, after employing readers for the past two years, I would
not be without them. Examples of personal reading made easy are the
none-too-brief government documents, bank statements, information from our landlord,
and handouts connected with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>our church classes and jobs. Also there are my
daughter Raeann's school papers, reports, teacher's notes, and field-trip
permission slips. What has worked best for Trudy and me is to find a reader who
can come the day after the school</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>material arrives home with Raeann because of the
short turnaround time needed for that material. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharon
Menlove is our current reader and has worked for us for two years. We met <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sharon</st1:place></st1:City> through our church
and knew her to be responsible. The privacy issue has never been a concern.
Just as if I had been hiring her on the job, I let <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Sharon</st1:place></st1:City> know what the job would entail and how
she would do it. I have been flexible. If there is a day when she cannot come
and if she lets me know a day ahead, we can reschedule. If something needs to
be read immediately, I arrange for a substitute.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
of this writing, I am looking for work. [He found it as a salesman for a drug
company.] I have hired a second reader, Doug Christy, who had worked with me on
my previous job at State Services for the Blind. Doug has read Job</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Service handouts, filled out job applications, and
helped with library research on employers. It has paid off. In a recent
interview I was told that I knew more than most applicants about the company.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
matter that is somewhat related to readers is customer service. I cannot
believe that I was so stubborn as to spend forty-five minutes or more trying to
find two items in a store by myself! Trudy cannot believe that I have cast</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my pride aside and now routinely ask for customer
assistance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
often than not, the clerks know the store better than the customer does. Not
only do I ow ask for customer service at stores, but I more readily ask for the
server's help in reading menus at restaurants if a Braille menu is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>not available. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
on readers and customer service saves time. All of us complain about not having
enough hours in the day. Hire readers and enlist customer service personnel,
and you will find that you are buying time to do fun or productive things. The
alternative is to waste time feeding your pride. Which investment gets the
greater return?</p>

is surprising how many blind people who know some Braille do not take full
advantage of what this powerful tool can offer. Louis Braille's invention was
revolutionary because for the first time blind people had the ability not only
to read but also to write. Herein lies Braille's power: it enables you to
communicate with yourself. Braille serves the same function for the blind as
print does for the sighted, and with a little creative thinking it can be just
as versatile. The use of Braille extends beyond reading books and magazines
from the library for the blind; it can also be employed to take notes, keep
records, and label everything under the sun. Once you start thinking creatively
about how your Braille skills can serve you better, you will be amazed at how
versatile Louis Braille's little invention actually can be. Here are some tips
for getting started. Soon you will wonder how you ever functioned without
Braille. Your only boundaries will be imposed by the limits of your

<h4>A Few Simple Tools</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Using
Braille as an organizational tool most often requires labeling or writing down
a few simple directions. Either a slate and stylus (a metal guide and a
punching device equivalent to the pencil or pen) or a Braille writer
(comparable to a typewriter) can be used. Labels are perhaps most commonly made
with Dymo Transparent Labeling Tape, made by 3M. This vinyl tape, with a
self-adhesive back protected with an easily removable strip, comes in a
twelve-foot roll. The half-inch width accommodates both standard and jumbo
Braille. The Braille labeling gun, as well as the Dymo tape attachment for the
Perkins Braille writer, are designed for this width. Moreover, many slates on
the market today now have a half-inch Dymo-tape slot. However, the experienced
Braillist can easily center the narrower 3/8th inch width in this slot and
produce labels in standard sized Braille. For cosmetic reasons and for the
convenience of any sighted members of your household, you may prefer the almost
transparent tape, which does not obscure what is underneath the Braille label.
Since transparent Dymo tape is often not readily available commercially, you
may have to purchase it from a supplier specializing in products for the blind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>These
labels can be directly affixed to the desired object after the backing is
peeled off, or they can be attached with a rubber band threaded through a hold
punched with a one-hole punch. The latter type has the advantage of being
reusable. You can take them with you to the grocery store and immediately mark
the can of green beans or chocolate pudding mix you are purchasing. Labels can
also be written on index cards or other pieces of Braille paper (usually three
to five times heavier than typing paper) and attached with Scotch or masking
tape or even a rubber band. Paper clips and a stapler also come in handy when
labeling print documents. If you have most of the above basic tools, then you

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Braille
labels are especially useful in the kitchen. Attaching paper or Dymo tape
labels to canned goods, jars, and other packaged foods helps to take some of
the uncertainty out of cooking. You no longer have to shake a can to try to
guess at its contents; your label will positively identify the green beans.
Sticking a Dymo tape label directly on small spice containers is most effective
since you can read it more easily this way. Since you will be using your
cinnamon or coriander jar over a period of time, you won't feel that you are
wasting expensive Dymo tape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
preparing foods it is crucial not only to identify the correct ingredients but
also to follow the indicated procedure. For storage keep them in a three-ring
binder; you can Braille your own recipes on regular Braille paper or on plastic
sheets (which can be wiped off should you spill flour, tomato sauce, or baby
food on them). You can also make note of directions for preparing such packaged
foods as Stove Top stuffing or chocolate pound cake and either keep them in
your folder or attach them directly to the package itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h4>Other Household Uses</h4>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
same techniques which proved valuable in the kitchen are just as useful in
other household areas. Labeling your cleaning supplies with Dymo tape, for
example, eliminates the possibility of confusing your oven cleaner with your
furniture polish. You can also label such items as shampoo and conditioner
bottles, which often feel the same, so that you can differentiate between them
before you pour the contents into your hand or onto your hair. Dymo tape also
works for labeling different colored spools of thread. Place the tape on the
flat side of the spool. Now you can choose the appropriate color thread for
mending or sewing on buttons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
can also identify different colored yarns for knitting and crocheting by
storing them in separate Ziploc bags with index cards noting their colors. This
method also works for keeping various shades of pantyhose separated. Other
clothes can be marked by sewing in Braille labels. Again several options are
available. These include Brailling on garment labeling tape, which is similar
to Dymo tape but without the adhesive backing, and making use of prefabricated
metal labels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Labeling
the controls on some household appliances may also prove helpful. Many modern
microwaves have no tactilely detectable buttons. Here Braille labels can serve
a dual purpose: not only do they help to locate the function keys, they also
identify them. Even if appliances have tactile controls, it may still prove
useful to label some of them, especially if you do not want to make the effort
to remember many different settings. Thus you may wish to attach Dymo tape
labels to your dishwasher, your washing machine, and your dryer. These labels
are especially helpful with the type of washing machines which use a dial to
select different wash cycles. You can use little triangle-shaped Dymo tape
arrows to point to the beginnings of various stages and place some identifying
letters or words nearby.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
will probably not need or want to label every single appliance in your home,
especially those that you are already familiar with or others which are simple
to use. But, on the other hand, do not be shy about labeling anything; after
all, the manufacturers always include print labels for sighted consumers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some complex
appliances such as video cassette recorders may require a different approach.
In addition to labeling some buttons, you may wish to make note of the layout
of the control panel since there may not be enough room to label all keys. You
may also want to write down the sequence of steps for operating your machine.
As you are programming the VCR, you can then refer to your notes on the
procedure. If you have a remote control device with a complicated layout, you may
again wish to take notes on the function of each key. After all you will want
to take full advantage of the power of your remote control when you are
lounging in your recliner, zapping through TV channels.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Perhaps
the most frequently labeled items are compact discs, audio and video cassettes,
and records. In this information age you will also need to label your computer
disks. Again you will probably want to choose Dymo tape for your labeling
medium. While you can record the artist's name and album title and perhaps some
other limited information of your choice on the compact disk box, you should
not place a label on the compact disk itself. With audio and video cassettes
you can label both the cassette and its container. The record cover can also be
easily labeled, as can the record itself, as long as you confine yourself to
the center, which also holds the print label. You may wish to follow a
consistent format in labeling the covers of the above items, e.g., placing the
artist's name on the spine of the audio tape so that you can arrange the tapes
alphabetically and easily retrieve a specific tape later. Your favorite Mozart
sonata or Beatles album will then be at your fingertips in moments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

all the above instances Braille is employed to adapt materials so that blind
people can make more effective use of them. Sometimes already labeled materials
are available for purchase. Popular choices include Monopoly and Scrabble.
Although you can also buy already labeled playing cards, it is easy to make
your own with a slate. Special slates have been designed for this purpose;

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Braille
is a very effective organizing tool for identifying and managing print
materials. You can label your bills using a slate or a Braille writer for easy
reference, noting on the envelope to whom the check must be issued, the amount
due, and the payment deadline&#8212;no more worries about that missing phone
bill. After writing out your checks, you can also label them in Braille with
the check number, the date, the amount, the name of the recipient, and any
additional information you need. When the checks are returned in your bank
statement, you can determine which ones have cleared, even if you do not
receive a Braille statement. If you are using carbon checks, you can use the
Braille information on your carbon to draw up your Braille check register.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It is also helpful to
label other important print documents to which you may need to refer later. These
Braille labels, which can be written directly on the print item or noted on a
separate piece of paper and either paper-clipped or stapled to the item, help
to locate the document as well as to identify such important information as the
account number on an insurance policy. Of course Braille is also invaluable in
filing these documents. You can either write directly on a file folder or
attach a Dymo tape label. The latter is easier to read and stands up to more
wear and tear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
can also create a Braille index card file using commercially available
materials for any names, addresses, and telephone numbers. You can employ the
same methods to label the alphabetic dividers as you used to label file
folders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
perhaps the most innovative labeling technique is the use of Dymo tape to mark
your credit, ATM, insurance, and airline frequent flyer cards, etc. As long as
you do not cover up the magnetic strip and your signature on the card, you
should not experience any problems, even using an ATM machine. Never again will
you have to resort to asking a stranger to paw through your wallet to select
the card you need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Of
course Braille is not the only method for keeping track of information and for
identifying and labeling items. You can use tape recorders, electronic
note-taking devices, and computers to store and retrieve information, and other
tactile identifiers such as rubber bands, strips of tape, or raised symbols
made with glue or Hi-Marks&reg; to mark items. However, none of these is as
flexible and versatile as Braille for managing personal and household tasks.
Far from becoming obsolete, Braille continues to be a valuable self-management
tool.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Braille&#8212;no more spaghetti with green beans for dinner. You can listen to
the music of your choice and rest assured that you can locate that phone bill

large-print watches, clocks, and timers; Braille-writing devices; handwriting
aids; measuring devices; kitchen gadgets; thermometers; and much more. The most
obvious difference between a catalog of low-tech devices of twenty-five years
ago and one today is the current preponderance of talking items, ranging from
functional talking watches, clocks, calculators, and thermometers to items
intended to be humorous like talking salt and pepper shakers. The introduction

Braille slates made in other countries incorporate a variety of intriguing
features such as magnets to hold the paper in place, top-hinged designs to
facilitate interpoint writing, folding designs, quiet-writing designs, very
small and very large Braille characters, Braille line numbers, and holes that
allow storage in a loose-leaf notebook. There is also a wide variety of shapes
and sizes, from a tiny four-cell hingeless slate for making marginal notes to
full-page models. There are bookkeeping slates and even antique varieties
designed for writing print. However, it is usually not just a matter of
importing these items for use in this country because, while they might include

Braille readers have never been encouraged to work to achieve good speed. Slow
reading is a disadvantage throughout life and causes the reader to under-use
and undervalue the reading skill. But there is no need to continue forever as a
slow reader. Some Braille readers develop a speed of 200 to 400 words per
minute as small children. They will retain that speed with little or no effort.
Braille readers who could not attain good speed as young children, however, can
do so with some work, and it is certainly worth the effort. It is also
desirable for teachers of blind children to encourage good Braille-reading
speed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Avoid all Braille printed on plastic pages. Plastic is somewhat better than it
was when it first appeared, but it will still discourage good speed. As you
develop more speed, it will seem worse, because your hands will cling to the
Braille as they move faster across the lines. Since Braille continues to become
easier to produce using Braille embossers driven by computers, using plastic
should not be necessary except in rare situations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Keep your touch light. You can feel the dots better if your fingers are moving
lightly over the lines. To test this statement, try this: feel the back of one
hand with the fingers of your other hand. Exert some pressure and rub your hand
a little. You will feel bones and veins. Now barely brush your fingers across
the skin. You will feel the texture of the skin and hairs. These details were
hardly noticeable when you pressed down. The same is true of Braille. You do
not want to know what is underneath the page, but what is on the surface. This
requires a light touch. Many Braille readers are heavy-handed. Experiment
honestly to see whether you are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Check the position of your hands to insure that you are using the most
sensitive part of your fingertips. Your hands should be curved so that the
second joints of your fingers are only a little higher than the first joints.
Your wrists should move just above the page. The most sensitive part of your
fingers is just below the tip, but not as far back as the fleshier part right
above the first joint.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

You will read best if you follow the lines of Braille using three fingers on
each hand. The middle and third fingers help to keep your place and increase
speed, even though the forefingers are the primary reading fingers. It is
always important to use both hands, even if one is less sensitive. Keep both
forefingers on the line of Braille. Almost everyone has one dominant hand in
reading, and it is not necessarily the same one that is dominant in other
activities. It is convenient to be able to use one hand well enough to read
while writing using a slate and stylus with the other. You can then copy brief
passages from what you are reading without taking your hand off the page.
Consider this technique for copying an address or phone number. You probably
don't have much choice about which hand works best, but you can increase the
effectiveness of both hands if you work at it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>5.
When you read Braille, you want your left hand to read the beginning of the
line and your right hand to read the end. The best readers bring their
forefingers together somewhere in the middle of the line, letting the right
hand finish while the left hand returns to the left margin to locate and begin
the new line. This process increases speed because you no longer have to pause
to locate the new line. Your dominant hand will read a larger part of the line,
but the two hands read independently, and your brain puts the words in correct
order. If you have been a one-handed reader, your first step is to make your
weaker hand follow the other one until it begins to help with the work. Make
the hand you are trying to strengthen read at least one word at the beginning
or end of the line. As you become more adept at this, what at first seemed to
slow you down will help increase your speed. When you experience success at making
your slow hand read one word, begin to require it to carry more of the load. If
one hand is truly disabled, you can still read Braille well enough to make it
valuable. If one hand is merely less sensitive than the other, make the weaker
hand work, and it will get more efficient.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In some ways improving Braille-reading speed is much like improving speed
reading print. We recommend that you first learn to skim. Learn to gather the
sense of a passage by reading the first lines of short paragraphs and the first
and last lines of slightly longer ones. If the paragraph is quite long, read a
few middle lines as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
you are reading conversation, skip or de-emphasize the &quot;he said,&quot;
&quot;she asked,&quot; &quot;I explained&quot; phrases. Don't try to skip these
in the middle of a line, but when they appear at the beginning or end and you
are not reading aloud, they are unnecessary. You will know the content, and
skipping unnecessary words is another way to permit your reading speed to
increase slightly. This is part of learning to skim rather than actually
increasing verbatim reading speed. If you expect to cover the material faster,
your hands and mind will learn to work together. All this helps your speed.
Several such techniques can add up to quite an improvement. You will learn not
to break the steady movement of your hands as you concentrate on what matters
in what you read.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Develop a sight vocabulary in Braille. This idea is especially helpful if you
have just completed learning Grade II Braille and need to build confidence in
your knowledge of contracted words. You can carry a packet of three-by-five
index cards with frequently used words or phrases on each. The earliest ones
you make should be no more than four symbols. With practice you will begin to
recognize the short words immediately. You can also recognize these letter
combinations as parts of longer ones. Example: the word &quot;and&quot; also
appears in the words &quot;strand,&quot; &quot;band,&quot; and
&quot;land,&quot; and so on. The word &quot;honest&quot; appears at the
beginning of &quot;honestly&quot; and at the end of &quot;dishonest.&quot; As
you recognize sight vocabulary words more quickly, the longer words which
contain them will come more quickly as well. When a group of twenty cards or so
becomes familiar, exchange them for another set. Carry them in your notebook or
purse; study them on the way to work or school; and make new ones when they
wear out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>8.
Set achievable goals for improvement. Determine how much you read every day. Be
truthful with yourself, even if you are only reading a paragraph a day. Set as
your first goal to double this amount or to increase it by 50 percent. Be
absolutely faithful to your daily commitment to read Braille. When you feel
comfortable reading this new amount, increase it again and make that your new
goal.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Be
sure to read every single day. Remember, it does not hurt to read more than the
minimum you have set. If one day you don't meet your commitment to yourself,
don't worry about it. Stress causes burn-out. Just begin where you left off and
continue achieving the same goal each day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Begin with very short passages. It does not take long to be able to read a
selection of three or four pages in one sitting. It feels wonderful when you
can say that you have read a whole story. Such success encourages other
attempts. You need not read material written at your intellectual level. Many
of us like to read children's stories. You can easily find short articles from
magazines.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>10.
Make Braille convenient for yourself. Keep a Braille book beside your bed, and
tell people you have learned to read in the dark. Leave a book or magazine near
your favorite easy chair. Carry a small magazine with you. Immerse yourself in
this exposure to Braille. Keep a Braille calendar in your pocket or purse.
Begin an address and phone file. Make recipes in Braille. Ask your friends if
they can show you what crossword puzzles look like in Braille or how to do
cryptograms, etc. Try to make Braille available to yourself in the many ways
that print is available to your sighted friends. The more you see it and find
it wherever you put your hands, the more you will read it. Reading Braille--as
much and as often as possible--is certainly the most important thing you can do
to increase your reading speed. Read, read, read!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>11.
One of the more effective ways to improve Braille skill is to read along with
someone else. A tape recorder will do. The aural reading should be just a
little faster than yours. Make yourself keep up. Reread the passage. The second
time you will be familiar with the material. Your speed should increase. Keep
at it till you are comfortable with the faster speed. Read something onto a
tape yourself. Compete with yourself, each time trying to beat the original
speed of your recording.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>12.
Subscribe to at least one Braille magazine that you enjoy. Read short articles,
and then reread them more than twice, trying to read faster each time. Do not
memorize. As the text becomes familiar, you will read much more rapidly. Be
sure to read aloud sometimes to be sure that you are not skipping when you know
the material well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>13.
As you begin to see improvement in your speed, continue spending the same
amount of time reading or doing even more. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City> faster will permit you to cover more
material in the same amount of time. In school children read many hours a day
while learning to read. As adults we expect to spend just a few minutes and
accomplish as much. In the beginning at least it won't happen. You must commit
time in order to see significant improvement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>14.
Avoid bad habits. Many Braille readers have developed the bad habit of
double-checking frequently in order to catch mistakes. It is important to keep
your hands moving steadily forward with very little checking back. Avoid
rubbing the Braille as you read it. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City>
with someone who reads just a little faster keeps you from looking back. If you
do, you will get behind. It is true that reading Braille requires movement, but
the movement should be mostly forward, not up and down or backwards. If you
move your hands up and down, you may move from one line to another without
realizing it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>You
can read together with someone else who is working to improve his or her speed.
You can even do this on the telephone. If you respond to competition, challenge
someone to compete with you. Occasional timings are helpful, but only to
determine if your reading speed increases. Don't overdo it. Instead of words
per minute, it might be more helpful to measure pages per hour or per week.
When you have something to read in Braille, complete it in that medium. Don't
cheat and finish it on tape.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Take some responsibility using Braille. For instance, make a report from
Braille notes. Give a speech using Braille cards. Make a report about something
you have read in Braille. NFB Kernel Books are filled with short and easy
articles, which may also provide motivation for improving this skill.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><a name=readingspeed2></a>Building Braille Reading Speed: Some Helpful
Suggestions</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Jerry Whittle</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: For those of us who were not taught to read</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Braille efficiently as children or who did not
become blind until adulthood, there are three Braille-reading options. We can
sit around lamenting our bad luck and wishing that we could read Braille the
way President Maurer does during his banquet addresses. We can learn a little
Braille and use it gratefully but with some difficulty--complaining all the
while about the frustration of not having Braille as a really first-rate tool
of literacy. Or we can set to and work on increasing our reading speed on the
theory that any increase will improve the usefulness of Braille and our
competitiveness in the job market and in life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Speaking
personally, I have chosen the last alternative and have been working to
increase my reading speed for several years now. Perhaps that is why I found
the following article both interesting and challenging. Finding the time to
read 10,000 pages or more of Braille a year, as Jerry Whittle recommends, sounds
like a tall order to me, but I have discovered that the more one reads, the
faster the words slide past under one's fingers, and I am already reading
between ten and fifteen pages a day. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
Whittle teaches Braille at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for the Blind. He
certainly knows what he is talking about when he gives advice about increasing
Braille reading speed. This article first appeared in the Winter, 1993, edition
of The Pathfinder, the publication of the National Federation of the Blind of
Louisiana. Here is what Mr. Whittle has to say: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
the past seven years I have had the opportunity to teach over two hundred blind
persons to read Braille. During that period I have timed twelve students at rates
of greater than three hundred words per minute. Of course, all of these rapid
readers had been reading Braille since early childhood, and none</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of them needed to improve speed; however, there were
some interesting similarities among many of them that are worthy of noting.
First of all, eleven of the twelve read with two hands, starting the line with
the left hand and finishing it with the right. Meanwhile, the left dropped down
to the next line to find</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the beginning and start reading as soon as the right
hand had finished. Only one of the twelve read more than three hundred words
per minute using only the right hand. In fact, he read over five hundred words
per minute. One of these twelve read one hundred sixty-nine words a minute when
he entered the center. At</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the beginning of his training he read with his left
hand only, but he moved both hands across the entire line and brought both all
the way back to the beginning of the next line, losing approximately one second
per line because of the inefficiency of this method. We encouraged him to read
the first half of each</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>line with his left hand, then track down to the
beginning of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>next line while finishing the line with his right.
Once he started practicing this more efficient method, he no longer lost that
second on each line since he could pick up the next one with his left hand as
soon as his right had finished the last. As a consequence he increased his
reading speed from one hundred sixty-nine to three hundred two words a minute
before graduating.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
years of teaching, it is absolutely clear to me that the two-handed technique
is by far the superior method. I remember another student who read only sixty
words per minute when she entered the center. She read with only her right
hand. She also took the advice to begin using both hands, and she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>increased her reading speed from sixty to one
hundred twenty words per minute in six months; however, I should point out that
she also read over three thousand Braille pages while she was a student at the
Louisiana Center for the Blind. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The number of pages
read is an extremely important factor in building speed. A large proportion of
Braille readers read at a rate of fifty to seventy words per minute. In order
to increase speed, once someone is reading at sixty words a minute or more, he
or she should read a minimum of ten thousand Braille pages a year, two hundred
fifty pages a week, thirty-five pages a day--give or take a few pages. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Setting
goals is another important factor in attaining good or excellent reading
speeds. I would suggest that one set page goals per day. For example, I
currently have a student who has just finished Grade II Braille, and she is
working diligently to build speed. When she first completed the code, she began
to read a short novel, setting a goal of ten pages per day. She set aside</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a certain time in the evening to accomplish this
rather ambitious task. During her first time test she read twenty-four words
per minute. During the next month she faithfully maintained her page goal and
even increased it to about fifteen pages per day. In her last timing she read
forty-five words per minute. Of course, some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of this speed resulted from her being able to pick
up words more rapidly from context, and this ability accelerated her reading rate.
Some of the improvement also resulted from her growing ability to pick up the
signs more easily through constant practice and in general from her consistent
hard work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
have noticed that most of the students who really work hard attain a level of
about sixty words per minute rather quickly after completing the code, usually
in two to three months. Then the rate of speed levels off. This observation is
not based on a controlled study but merely on my observation. What usually
happens is that students are able to increase speed rapidly because the faster
they read, the more it makes sense to them, and the more they pick up by
context. For example, &quot;Jack and Jill went up the ...&quot;: it does not
take a mental giant to guess that the final word of this sentence will be
&quot;hill.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
once the student has reached a speed that takes account of contextual
prediction, the rate levels off, and it then takes reading a tremendous number
of pages to continue to increase steadily--at least ten thousand pages per year.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
best readers at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for the Blind who
knew no Braille before entering the Center have learned to read at a rate of
fifty to seventy-five words per minute in six to nine months. The student in
this category who attained the greatest speed before graduation read at a rate
of seventy-five</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>words per minute. That person read over eight
thousand pages during that six-month period. She actually stayed in her
apartment on many weekends and read Braille diligently. In other words she
approached her Braille reading as if it were a job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
would also suggest that those working to increase their reading speed work on
their Braille before becoming too fatigued. If you are an early morning person,
read early in the day. I know a former student who arises at five o'clock in
the morning to read Braille before he begins to prepare for school at seven.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Others
are able to read late at night and set aside the time to do so. I also think it
is important to read aloud during part of this reading time so that one does
not develop sloppy reading habits. For example, when one reads aloud, it is
hard to mumble through words; one must be exact. Also, by reading aloud
periodically, one can begin to develop good reading techniques for delivering
speeches or for reading in public places, such as church or before civic
organizations. Additionally, reading aloud enables one to hear how fast he or
she is picking up a line or to identify where any problems lie. I once had a
student who was timed at three hundred fifteen words per minute. When she read</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>aloud in public, she tried to read at that speed.
She sounded like she was on fast forward. While she attended the center, she
worked on improving her speech-making techniques. She tried to slow down to a
reading rate of about one hundred twenty words per minute, and her speaking
style improved tremendously.Incidentally, President Clinton's Inaugural Address
was read at a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rate of one hundred twenty words per minute, about
the proper rate for communication of ideas without losing one's audience. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
suggestion is to set a timer for five minutes and read aloud during this
interval. If you can finish a Braille page in five minutes, you are reading at
a rate of forty words per minute. If you read two pages, your rate is eighty
words per minute. If you complete three, you are reading at a rate of one</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hundred twenty words per minute. By setting a timer
periodically, one can see how much progress is being made, and the timer acts
as a very good motivator to read faster. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
conclusion I would say that building reading speed requires hard work and
consistency. It does little good to read thirty pages in one day and wait a
week to read another thirty pages. The reading must be done on a consistent,
day-by-day basis until a certain level of efficiency has been established. One</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>must approach the challenge of increasing reading
speed in the same way one approaches a job. Many students carry Dr. Jernigan's
and President Maurer's banquet speeches around with them on trips in order to
get in some reading in airplanes or in doctor's offices. These Braille speeches
are lightweight and quite</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>portable. It is amazing how much time one spends
waiting, and this time can be used to increase reading speed. Most important,
it is essential that one set high page goals, not necessarily time goals. Ten
pages per day is a better goal than one hour. The two-handed technique is by
far the best for optimum reading</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>speed. Find something that holds your interest. If
you are just beginning to read for speed, choose a book or magazine article
that is not too complicated and work your way into more sophisticated reading
material. Finally, read! read! read! Always read with both hands, and set
ambitious page goals for yourself. If I can be of any further assistance in
your quest to build reading speed, please call me at (318) 251-2891.</p>

I hung up the phone, I thought to myself, &quot;I bet Sue has no idea what she
has just done.&quot; To her it was probably just another routine thing to do.
But as I told my husband about it, I felt the warmth that true acceptance
brings flowing through me and giving a spark to my comments.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Jim,&quot;
I said, &quot;Sue just called and suggested that we have our school
parent-teacher conferences back to back so I can watch Eric during hers and she
can watch Marsha and John during ours. She asked if I would arrange it since
she's real busy at work during Larry's free time.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was a routine call about a routine matter for parents. So what was I so thrilled
about? It was the first time anyone had talked to me about watching their
children without commenting in some way or expressing some apprehension about
my blindness. Sue did tell me later that people had asked her about how she
could trust me to watch Eric. She had told them that all she knew was that my
children seemed fine and well cared for to her and whenever she wanted to know
specifically how I did things she asked. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
Sue is still an exception in this and many other everyday circumstances for the

approaches we face, such as that with Chong. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chong,
like Sue and several others, had been providing rides for my children to and
from pre-school. Occasionally, she would invite my children to play with hers
after school and then bring them home. They enjoyed it, and as they got to know
Jenny and Bryan better, wanted to have them to our house. The first couple of
times I asked Chong about it, the reasons they couldn't seemed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>plausible. But by the third time, it seemed that
perhaps reasons were becoming excuses. My children began wondering aloud why
Chong's children couldn't play at our house. At one point, Marsha said she
thought Jenny was disappointed about not coming. I thought about blind friends
who had talked about this kind of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thing. Now it was happening to me. Perhaps we were
all paranoid and jumping to conclusions. I thought of Sue and decided we
weren't. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
next time I talked to Chong, I said that my children loved to play at her
house, but they were wondering why they could never play with Jenny and Bryan
at ours. I talked about Jenny's apparent disappointment. Then I took the plunge
and asked if my blindness had anything to do with it. She said shyly, &quot;No,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>not really.&quot; I said that if it felt
uncomfortable to her, I would be glad to explain how I do things or answer
questions. I told her I am used to doing that. She said she didn't have any
questions, and we arranged for a time for them to come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
the day that they were to come, she called and said that <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Bryan</st1:place></st1:City> was sleeping late and she would prefer
not to wake him. I said we weren't on a schedule that would make their coming
later a problem. I was relieved when she agreed to that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
they arrived, I explained to them in their mother's presence that I was going
to put bells on their shirts so I would be able to hear where they were going.
I also explained my rule about answering when I call their name unless we were
playing hide and seek -- something which is only done with everyone knowing
before the game starts.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the time their mother left until she returned, three-year-old Jenny asked
almost nonstop questions about my blindness. She wanted to know how I kept
track of things, how I got food, how I knew where I was going, how I read
stories, how I knew what color things were, how I picked out my clothes, how I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>washed myself and my children, how I knew who people
were, etc. When I changed her two-year-old brother's diaper, she watched with
keen interest as I cleaned him and snapped up his clothes. The children all had
a good time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Chong came to get
Jenny and Bryan, I told her what a good time we had all had. I said Jenny had
asked a lot of questions and had been very interested in how I do things. I
then told her what Jenny had asked and how I had answered. She listened
intently, occasionally adding a comment or question of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>her own. As they prepared to leave, Jenny, who had
been in the other room with my daughter during most of Chong's and my conversation,
talked excitedly to her mother about my ways of doing things, most of which
were just like hers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
had the distinct impression that Chong and Jenny had wondered to each other
about things before coming to our house. Both the bubbly three-year-old and the
reserved mother seemed pleased about learning new things, and our relationship
thereafter was much more relaxed and comfortable. </p>

that time, I have had many opportunities to supervise other people's children.
Sometimes the parent or parents have been immediately receptive to trade-offs

perspective on this is that we, through our everyday lives, are making

who won't accept our lives for what they are. Sue and others like her give
substance to our acceptance of ourselves as part of the mainstream of society.
I</p>

find it more possible to do so. As they challenge us to live what we say, we
reach to do that, too. As we in the National Federation of the Blind share our
experiences with each other and with the rest of society, we will find
encouragement and the strength to continue to educate ourselves so that the
success of acceptance will breed success. It is a privilege to be a part of the
process. </p>

misunderstanding and lack of information which exist. If a blind person has
proper training and opportunity, blindness can be reduced to the level of a</p>

where I had lived for the past five years. I was excited. Finally I had a place
of my own. No more paying rent. No more repeated calls to the caretaker to beg
him to fix my sink. I was free at last. I had just moved into my
newly-purchased condominium and was happy to have more space and to live in a
quieter neighborhood.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the move had gone relatively smoothly. In fact, this was the easiest move I
could ever remember. Now that all ten of my volunteer moving crew had left, I
decided it was time to take out some garbage. We had already unpacked some of
my boxes, and they were neatly stacked near the door. I decided it was time to
get rid of them before the pile became too large.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

remember that, when I had first looked at the house, one of the other owners
had warned me that the dumpster would be very difficult for me to find. She
said I would probably need some help with it. She let me know about another

appreciated her concern, but I would do just fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my boxes onto my shoulder, I made my way down the back stairs and out to the
parking lot. A sighted friend had informed me that I could go out and walk
straight ahead for a few yards, take a left and go about twice as far again,
and I would be at the dumpster.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tried following these directions, but alas, no dumpster. I worked my way around
several cars in the parking lot and searched for the dumpster but was unable to
find it. Within a few minutes a woman came out and showed me where it was. I
thanked her politely but inwardly felt humiliated, frustrated, and even a bit
angry. It was just not fair. I had just bought my own place, organized the
move, and now I could not seem even to take out my own garbage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

few days later I invited a friend to my house. My pile of boxes had grown
rather large, and there were several bags of trash that needed to be taken out.
I asked my friend for some assistance since there was so much to haul. At this
point there was a lot of snow in the back of the building, and many cars were
parked there. My friend commented, &quot;This is really going to be hard for
you to find. There are really no landmarks; you just have to find your way
through open space.&quot; She offered several suggestions for ways to locate
the dumpster. I tried them later that week and was not very successful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
reader of this account might be wondering why this was such a difficult task
for me. The dumpsters are located across an alley, where many cars are parked,
and the snow is not shoveled very well in the winter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would be possible to move the dumpsters closer to the building. She said no.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
I decided that enough was enough. I was going to find a way to locate these

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
time I really made an effort to notice my surroundings and changes in the
terrain as I moved closer to the dumpsters. Upon finding them, I took time to
look around the whole area. I noticed that there was a garage within several
feet of the dumpsters. I had also noted a fence and several trees along my
path. As I returned to my house, I wondered why nobody had pointed out these
environmental cues to me, especially the garage. In a way I was glad they
hadn't because it gave me the opportunity to discover them on my own.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By
now, as you can probably guess, taking out the trash at my new place is a
routine task, and I don't even think about it. While this was a relatively
small incident in my life, it made me think about some garbage we blind people
can collect in our attitudes if we are not careful.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the biggest pieces of garbage we can collect is the idea that sighted people
have more information about the environment than blind people do and that they
know best what we can do and how we should do it. While sighted people can
provide valuable information, they do not necessarily have all the information.
As Federationists know, blind people are often the best teachers of other blind
people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
second piece of garbage we need to take out of our lives is excessive anger and
frustration. Whether we are blind or sighted, if we are honest with ourselves,
we all experience frustration in our lives to one degree or another. Anger and
frustration can be our friends if they move us to action. They can sound an
alarm that calls us to wake up and make a change in our lives. At a certain
level the NFB came into existence because of positive anger. People were angry
about the lack of opportunities for blind people and the negative stereotypes
society often has about us, so they did something about it. On the other hand,
anger becomes an enemy when it paralyzes us and saps us of the creative energy
we need to solve problems in our lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
third piece of garbage that needs to be disposed of is plain, old-fashioned
laziness. If you're like me, you prefer things to be easy rather than hard.
Unfortunately, much of life is not easy. I think we all know several blind
people who would rather have things done for them than learn the alternative
techniques that would enable them to do things themselves. I fear that this
attitude will not pay off in the end.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

as I found a way to get my trash to the dumpster, all of us need to find ways

you recall the children's song called, I seem to remember, &quot;This is the
Way We Wash Our Clothes&quot;? In successive verses singers work their way
through the days of the week demonstrating with motions the way we wash our
clothes, iron our clothes, mend our clothes, sweep the floor, and bake the
bread. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With the ironing
board and the broom nearly extinct today and the bread machine creating most of
the fresh bread in modern homes, perhaps children no longer take delight in
singing this little tune. On the other hand, I had very little idea of what a
wash board was when I was a child, yet we vigorously mimed washing our clothes
on a wash board. It never occurred to us to wonder where the washing machine
had disappeared to in the song.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
had a bit of vision when I was a small child, but not enough to pick up the
motions that went with the song by observing the leader or the other children.
My mother carefully taught me how to move my hands and arms and also what those
motions represented. I suspect I may have been the only child in my group who
knew that those pushing gestures in the Thursday verse represented kneading the
bread.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Mother wasn't satisfied simply to teach me to go through the motions of taking
care of a home; she insisted that I learn how to be an effective member of the

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
first laundry task as a small child was to collect my father's dress shirts for
their trip to the laundry, where the collars could be starched stiff, the way
Dad liked them. I liked the stiff collars too, because it was easy to find them
quickly in the dirty clothes hamper. The rest of the laundry got sorted on the
basement floor. Underwear and sheets could go together. Jeans, wash pants, and
boys' and men's socks formed the basis of another pile. Obviously delicate
fabrics made a third stack. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

those things out of the way, I was left with all the pieces that might be light
colored or might be dark. There was nothing to do but learn to identify them. I
quickly discovered that I already knew the colors of my own clothes. I knew
what I had worn in recent days and thrown into the wash. For the rest of the
family I had to memorize the colors by identifying texture, buttons, and
location of pockets and zippers. In the early days Mother checked to see that I
had sorted the loads correctly, but eventually we learned to trust my own
decisions. After all, if I really wasn't sure in which pile a garment belonged,
I could leave it out for later consultation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Naturally
I had to learn the hard way to check for crayons in pockets. But all of us have
discovered to our sorrow what happens when a red crayon melts in the dryer all
over a load of light-colored clothes. Actually, throughout all the years of
laundry for my own three children, I had surprisingly few of these
catastrophes. This is undoubtedly because my fingers pay close attention to
information like a bit of extra weight or a hard object in a pocket under
several layers of cloth. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like
every other washing machine in the nation, mine has always tended to eat socks.
I cannot imagine where so many single socks can disappear in a load of wash.
Before I discovered the solution to this problem, we had a designated orphan
drawer in our house. All unmated socks that came through the wash went into
that drawer. In an emergency a desperate child could usually assemble a
passable pair of socks from the extras.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Then
I decided to take radical action. I couldn't match a dryer full of single socks
anyway, so I put a bowl of safety pins in the bathroom and told everybody to
pin socks together before they went into the laundry baskets. I promised that,
if socks were pinned, they would be returned to the owner folded together. If
they went through the wash one by one, they would be dumped into the orphan
drawer. Everyone soon learned that it was simpler to pin the socks together
than to brave the sock drawer in search of something to wear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

certainly don't iron nearly as much as my mother did or as I did when I was a
kid. But mine still gets a fair workout, even today. Partly this is because I
have the luxury of a laundry room on the second floor. It is a converted sun
porch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

we first moved to our home, built in 1891, I found myself carrying laundry from
the bathroom at the back of the second floor to the staircase at the front of
the house and then back to the basement steps at the rear of the first floor.
Our house is large--thirteen rooms--and our then toddler was frightened to be
left alone while I went off to feed the washer and dryer. So I usually carried
not only the dirty clothes but also the squirmy baby whenever I made this
extended trip. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

was great exercise, but I began to have fantasies about having the washer and
dryer on the second floor. That is where they have been now for twenty years,
and it is a lovely arrangement. The only drawback is that I am tempted to toss
a load into the washer late in the evening and into the dryer just before
tumbling into bed. The result is wrinkles.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I rather enjoy ironing. I don't burn myself more than occasionally. The iron
radiates enough heat to tell my left hand exactly where it is. With just a bit
of practice it is easy to determine by touch whether the wrinkles have
disappeared. And, if I accidentally press in a crease, a spritz of water allows
me to press it out again.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

fill my steam iron with distilled water to prevent stains from mineral deposits
on the clothes. Using a funnel, I put the water into a clean dish-washing-liquid
bottle. The nozzle lid on my recycled plastic bottle allows me to invert it
over the iron's water well before opening the nozzle and squeezing out enough
water to fill the iron. I can hear the well filling, but even if it overflows a
bit, holding the iron flat for a moment allows it to spit out the excess before
I put it down on the fabric.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

her sisters to follow her to food and play. The little sister did not survive,
and Sheriff had an incurable eye infection from birth that left her completely
blind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
friend told us about his blind kitten, mentioning that he did not have any
takers for this perfectly healthy, happy, bouncy kitten because she was blind.
We knew what that could mean, and we offered to take Sheriff if no one else
wanted her. We wouldn&#8217;t give her up now to anybody.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
were worried about stairs, her finding the cat boxes, and interaction with the
other cats whom we now call the Great Cats in comparison to little Sheriff.
Here&#8217;s how each of these worked. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
first we kept Sheriff in a room with a cardboard box across the door. This
prevented her from getting out, but we and the Great Cats could get in. We were
worried that, if we let Sheriff roam, she would fall down one of our two
staircases, both of which have turns in them. We got a bell on a blue collar so
that we could find Sheriff and avoid stepping on her. We would put the collar
on only when we were taking her out of the room. She got so she purred when we
put the collar on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
tried to show her stairs, making her little feet look at the edges and risers.
She didn&#8217;t like the lessons. We made her go down, one stair at a time, to
get the idea. She hated this. Then, one day about a week after we had Sheriff,
we noticed that she was upstairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
had put her on the floor downstairs to play and gone about our business,
keeping an ear on her movements, or so we thought. Suddenly, she was upstairs.
It turned out that Sheriff knew all about stairs. There was a short flight in
her original home in a garage, and she had used them from the time she was
tiny. She still kind of galumps down the stairs, being a little too short from
nose to tail to walk down yet. But she obviously will. She&#8217;s taught us
that. We tried to protect her, to ease her into our home a bit at a time. She
wasn&#8217;t having any of that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
talked about this and decided that, even as long as we have both lived as blind
people, we can still learn about the capabilities of the blind. In fact, both
of us have had experiences where people think we can&#8217;t do something and
(from what they intend as kindness), prevent us from doing it. Stairs are one
example. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
were recently in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Washington</st1:City>
 <st1:State w:st="on">D.C.</st1:State></st1:place> visiting our Congressman,
and we were heading out of the building to get a cab. As we approached the
door, a Capitol guard prevented us from going any farther, telling us that she
would &quot;take us&quot; to a door without stairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
had chosen this particular door because it got us where we were going. Had we
been &quot;taken&quot; to any other door, stairs or not, it would have been a
lot farther from our destination. We insisted; she relented, and we exited as
planned, stepping down the stairs as agilely as sighted visitors. I
couldn&#8217;t help thinking of Sheriff and the help we had tried so hard to
give her as I descended. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Regarding
accidents, we simply haven&#8217;t had any. We don&#8217;t exactly know how she
finds the cat boxes (we have two, one on each floor). We guess it is by using
her sense of where she is as well as her nose. Early on, we worked very hard at
being sure she was back in her room every two hours or so when she was a
one-room kitten to be sure she would be near a box she knew. Just like with the
stairs, one day we noticed that a cat was scratching in the downstairs cat box,
and each of us had a Great Cat on our laps. So much for thinking Sheriff
couldn&#8217;t find the cat box.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How
about the other cats? GirlKitty is deeply suspicious of everyone but Doug whom
she loves. Before Sheriff was even out of the carrying case in which she
entered our house, GirlKitty was at the front door, glaring through the bars
and hissing. In fact, we started calling her Miss Propane because she put her
whole body into the effort, sounding like one of those propane tanks that cause
lift in hot air balloons. She would even propane at Doug if he had been holding
Sheriff, and she got a whiff of it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the early days, GirlKitty would punch Sheriff occasionally; you could hear
Sheriff sort of go flying the other direction from the one she had been heading
in. And once I think GirlKitty was actually holding her down and socking
her&#8212;I was in the next room on the phone and, by the time I got in there,
they were separated. But the thing we noticed most was that Sheriff never
reacted to these expressions of disgust by GirlKitty. They were usually
delivered right in Sheriff&#8217;s face. But her body didn&#8217;t move at all.
We knew because the bell didn&#8217;t tinkle. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
talked about this as well, relating it to our own experiences. Eye contact is
crucial to cat communication, but it&#8217;s very important to people as well. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>GirlKitty
seemed very puzzled that she was getting no reaction from her fierce glare and
hiss. We have both known people who were very uncomfortable talking to us. It
has often seemed to us that part of the discomfort comes from lack of eye
contact and uncertainty on the sighted person&#8217;s part that we can detect
they are talking to us. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
Sheriff&#8217;s case, of course, it just may be that Sheriff has better manners
than GirlKitty. Anyway, she&#8217;s found her own form of revenge. GirlKitty is
very food-focused since she almost died as a baby from lack of nourishment. For
a while, she said horrible things to Sheriff when the little kitten would try
to join the Great Cats at the dry food dish. So Sheriff figured out that she could
fit under the kitchen stool that happens to sit next to the cats&#8217; food
station. GirlKitty can&#8217;t. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
Sheriff gets under the stool and sticks her head out long enough to grab some
food and then withdraws under the stool to eat. GirlKitty can&#8217;t do a thing
about it except stalk off in distaste. We didn&#8217;t teach Sheriff about the
stool. She figured it out for herself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then there&#8217;s Bob, our large, mellow, kindly, clingy male. One day early
on when Bob was eating, I put Sheriff on his back. Bob kept eating. Sheriff
slid off on purpose. I put her back. Bob kept eating. This went on for a while
because I was trying to teach Sheriff that one of the Great Cats was not a
meanie. She learned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
she finds Bob now, she jumps up on his shoulder or up his side in play. Bobby
will sort of run and fight back appropriately, not knocking Sheriff across the
room as he easily could but batting and taking evasive action as part of the
game. They tussle like that. Then Sheriff loses physical contact and starts
looking around with her paws for Bobby. (Doug calls her Scatters when she does
this&#8212;running back and forth in very short spurts in a search pattern.) <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
she doesn&#8217;t find Bobby and he still wants to play, he will scrabble his
back claws very fast on the linoleum or hardwood. Sheriff hears this and jumps.
They start the cycle again. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Doug
and I have laughed about this as well, having met people in our lives who are
immediately comfortable with us, realizing that, although we respond to oral
instead of visible cues, we are otherwise pretty much just ordinary people.
Bobby got that idea right away with Sheriff. But he also tires of the
kitten&#8217;s endless playfulness. When this happens, he vaults over Sheriff
and trots off.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sheriff
is still learning. When she came to us at six weeks old, she was too small to
look at chairs with her paws and understand them. We would hold her in a chair
and then put her down. She learned to climb up the upholstered recliner in her
first room using claws, but she often misjudged and fell down before she
learned. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She&#8217;s
now four months old and has a much longer wheel base from nose to tail. She has
looked at the kitchen chairs with her paws, figured out how they are made,
learned that they are comfortable, and now regularly hops into one or another.
That is how she gets on the table. I now keep the chair next to mine pushed in
all the way. Sheriff can get her head and upper arms up on the table but not
the rest of her. So she sits there when I&#8217;m eating, for all the world
like a little cat person except that she&#8217;d rather be onthe table helping
me with dinner. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
she applied her knowledge about kitchen chairs to all the other seating devices
in our house. You never know now in which chair or sofa you will find her. We
didn&#8217;t teach her about chairs at all. By the time she learned, we had
figured out that she did better learning on her own. We just get out of the way
and let her explore. She does just that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
are lots of other stories I&#8217;d love to tell: Like the fact that Sheriff
gets in the middle of a wide open space like the kitchen floor and just plain
dances&#8212;hopping and jumping and leaping to music only she can hear. Like
the swisher toy we have&#8212;long strips of plastic attached to a rigid stick
that you can shake in the air or tap on the ground, moving it around quickly
for Sheriff to hear and attack, which she does with the same speed a sighted
kitten would. Like the Great Cats hiding when the new bathroom was being put in
while Sheriff hung around outside the door, listening and smelling and talking
with the workers, as fascinated as the Great Cats were scared. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
I won&#8217;t. Instead, I&#8217;ll just say that Doug and I have been in the
National Federation of the Blind for a long time and worked hard to learn that
we can handle daily living tasks, jobs, home management just like our sighted
associates. And we have both worked hard to spread that word to our fellow
blind brothers and sisters as well as to our sighted friends. Even so, in the
last three months, we&#8217;ve learned again the lesson of how easy it is to
underestimate the capabilities of the blind. We were taught this lesson by a
little black kitten we call Sheriff.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

When they invited a tiny blind kitten to join them and their two sighted, older

insistence on being left alone to explore and do for herself. Now Peggy, who

it&#8217;s hard to say for sure what Sheriff&#8217;s adventures tell us about
blindness, there is no question what they tell us about the Elliott household:
It&#8217;s a great place to be a cat! And perhaps it only stands to reason that
a blind cat would try to make the same adaptations to cat life as a blind human
does to human living. In any case, for cat lovers, it is a delightful story.
Here is what Peggy has to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our
little blind kitten has grown into a 9-pound teen-ager, tomboy, and endless
source of amusement and pleasure. When we last reported about Sheriff, she was
a newcomer to our house, recently retrieved from the vet who had cured all her
outside-kitty parasites and given us soothing ointment for her infected eyes.
Soothing is all we could do; Sheriff cannot see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
has never bothered Sheriff. She&#8217;s constantly busy. Most cats play with an
object for a while and then lose it. Sheriff picks favorite toys and keeps them
around for weeks. The most recent one is a mouse with a bell on its tail.
She&#8217;ll smack it, chase it down, capture it, and smack again. When the
game is over for a time, she&#8217;ll leave it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
thing about her, though, is that she remembers where. Later, you&#8217;ll see
her carrying it in her mouth to a new hockey area or hear the bell jingling in
another room. Now we think one of the older cats has finally stolen and hidden
the mouse. But Sheriff always finds another toy.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Cellophane
packages are another favorite, and Wednesday grocery day with all the fresh
sacks on the floor is a highlight of the week for Sheriff. She hasn&#8217;t
done this for awhile, but she used to find a sack, put her front paws and
shoulders in, lie down, and push herself and the sack forward while making a
prrt prrt prrt sound for all the world like a little feline motorboat. When the
sack would hit the cabinets and stop, she would go to find another and repeat
the process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Toys
are an important part of Sheriff&#8217;s day. Of course anything she plays with
has to make or create sound. I think it&#8217;s fair to say her very favorite
toys are Doug and me. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
she was tiny, Sheriff spent hours climbing up and down the ladders on our
ladderbacked kitchen chairs. When she would reach the top, she would balance
there, all four feet on the top rung, very pleased with herself and sometimes
bold enough to bat at a passing human toy. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She&#8217;s
too big now to do this climbing act; she&#8217;d just knock the chair over if
she tried. So she&#8217;s modified the game. Now she puts her back feet on the
seat of an empty chair and her front paws on the top rung. She positions
herself there when a human toy is going to pass and then bats out at you,
swatting accurately at Doug or me as we pass.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

amazing what Sheriff can find that fits the sound-making toy bill. One of us
got a small electrical appliance, a tape recorder or something, that came
packed in styrofoam peanuts. We already knew about Sheriff&#8217;s love of
peanuts. They make nice scratching sounds as they move across a surface. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

dejected (we thought) Sheriff hopped off the bed and, after a little time had
passed, began batting another styrofoam peanut around the floor. I can&#8217;t
even begin to tell you how annoying the sound of a styrofoam peanut and a
joyful cat can be in the middle of the night. This went on for days. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

the little creep was clever enough to get the next one only after a pause so
that we weren&#8217;t sure what the distance was from her supply to the torture
chamber that the bedroom had become while she had access to the endless supply.
It&#8217;s gone now, and we&#8217;re careful to throw all peanuts away the

around her in her mind. We had a recliner set at right angles to a couch with a
coffee table in front of the couch. Sheriff would get on Doug&#8217;s knee in
the recliner, reach out with her paw to find the edge of the coffee table, hop
to the table, and then hop to the couch. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a while, we decided the coffee table was too much in that setting and removed
it. For weeks thereafter, Sheriff would get on Doug&#8217;s knee, reach for the
edge of the coffee table, reach farther, lean way out, wave around with her
paw. She was convinced for a long time that she just wasn&#8217;t reaching far
enough since she knew there was a surface there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

is not afraid to try new routes. In an area she is not sure about, she checks
with a paw before stepping. But then she remembers the pattern for later. Our
front stairs turn twice, and our back stairs turn once. At the top and bottom
of both, one must pick angles to arrive at different locations. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

has taken to racing people up and down the stairs and winning. In the morning,
she waits at the top of the front stairs, usually used by the first person up.
When one of us starts down, she leaps into motion, races ahead, and invariably
beats us to the kitchen. She&#8217;s running all the way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

tied a string on a knob of my dresser as a cat toy. Neither older cat has to my
knowledge so much as looked at the string. For about nine months, the string
formed part of Sheriff&#8217;s morning ritual. She would flop down on the floor
under the string and commence to swat, bite, kick, and roll in reaction to and
activation of the string. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

game would last for ten to fifteen minutes a day, and she kept this up for
about nine months. She&#8217;s tired of that game now and doesn&#8217;t do it

morning, knowing where it was and how to play the game.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sheriff got caught in a little dead-end hallway off the main upstairs hall.
GirlKitty (one of the older cats) was standing at the mouth of the dead-end,
growling at her. I stepped over GirlKitty and started downstairs. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

it occurred to me that there was a reason why GirlKitty, the only Sheriff hater
I know, was growling. She was penning Sheriff in the dead-end. I stopped about
three steps down and reached through the widely-spaced rails into the dead-end.
Sheriff was sitting right on the edge. I petted her and went on down a few more
stairs. Then I heard Sheriff flop onto the stairs. She had figured out that, if
I was there, she could be there, too. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

didn&#8217;t quite know the distances, but she did know that she had been trapped

the same information she had.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of how Sheriff thinks reminds me of the shrimp. We were having boiled shrimp
one night, and we decided to put an empty bowl over the tails in the tail bowl
as a protection against marauding cats. All three know they are not supposed to
be on the table and steal food, but, well, you know cats. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

you leave an unusually juicy morsel unguarded, you have to take your chances.
So we devised the tail bowl protector to save ourselves the trouble. First we
heard the bowl being investigated and moved a bit, followed by a disappointed
Bobby (the other older cat) leaving the table with his trademark
&quot;prrrt&quot; as he jumps. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

reached over to put a tail in the bowl and discovered little Sheriff
industriously working on uncracking the puzzle. She had examined the container
with the good smells very carefully with her front paws and had gotten one paw
in between the lips of the two bowls. When Doug happened to reach over, Sheriff
had the two bowls separated and was working her nose into the widening gap. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
had unlocked the puzzle neither older, sighted cat had had the patience or
persistence to deconstruct and was about to graze upon the ambrosia easily
withheld from both older cats. Though I don&#8217;t specifically remember, I
can guess that either Doug or I rewarded her persistence after we removed her
from the table.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
then there are the dropped things in the kitchen. When a human is in the
kitchen, Sheriff is usually there too, just in case. She wouldn&#8217;t want to
withhold an opportunity from a human to give her treats. To be fair, she
usually hangs around one of us wherever we are. But, back to the kitchen. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

you drop, from an ice cube to a spoon to a few kernels of frozen corn escaped
from the bag. Anything. If Sheriff is in the kitchen, she will probably find it
more quickly than we do. The minute something hits the floor, she leaps into
action, using her ears and her knowledge of the kitchen to run right to the
dropped thing and &quot;kill&quot; it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
seems to understand that these things are not usually subject to the game of
cat hockey. It&#8217;s just a mere matter of finding. And she likes to race to
the dropped object, being the first to find it. She&#8217;s even come tearing
in from the dining room, around the refrigerator and into the end of the
kitchen to find something. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

that we know the game, it&#8217;s a matter of pride to find the dropped thing
before the cat does. But I would say that the score is about 50-50 even though
the human doing the dropping is usually closer when the drop occurs.
Sheriff&#8217;s good.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most fun thing of all about Sheriff, though, is her intense conviction that she
can communicate. Some of the communication, of course, deals with food. We
recycle cans after washing them in the dishwasher and store them in the back
hallway for the weekly city pick-up. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

Sheriff was quite little, she dug an empty, dishwashed tuna can out of the

statement of desire.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sheriff
has never repeated that ploy since it didn&#8217;t work. But when someone opens
the refrigerator, you may find Sheriff there, standing on her back legs and
touching the tuna can sitting on the second shelf at the left. She is always
ready to let us know just where it is.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Sheriff
also knows that her bell gives her away. Most of the time, you can hear the
bell merrily ringing as Sheriff trots along or rolls over during a nap.
Sometimes you&#8217;d swear she&#8217;s intentionally ringing the bell louder
when she&#8217;s happy and running around. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I say, Sheriff is certain she can communicate her wishes. She likes to snuggle
down in bed against one of us for the night. She has a favorite place next to
Doug, and she&#8217;s sometimes ready for sleep before we are. Every now and
then we&#8217;ll be talking, and a sleepy paw will appear very gently on
Doug&#8217;s mouth. The message is clear.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

interpreter at the United Nations. I became a political junkie in the seventh

was the ordinary things that gave them trouble. I was expected to dust
furniture, but my mother gave up on teaching me how to sweep floors when I

learned how to measure, pour, stir, and chop. I did not learn how to use the

they were terrific.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

they had never heard of the National Federation of the Blind. They had very
limited contact with blind adults who were earning a living and managing their

cleaned up afterwards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
you have occasion to dine out, what do you look for in a restaurant? Would you
choose one close by or on a good bus line? Are you interested in a reasonable
price? Would you rather eat in a hurry and be on your way, or would you prefer
to have a leisurely dinner with smartly-uniformed waiters who will serve you in
fine fashion? Depending on your personal preference, you have a wide variety of
options from which to choose from self-service cafeteria to sit- down dining
room, where your every wish is the command of the attentive staff. A blind
person recently called the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
office of the National Federation of the Blind to report a problem he had
encountered with two chain buffet restaurants in the area. He said that he had
been told by the managers that he was not to return to their establishments
unless he brought someone to help him. His experience stimulated a seminar
discussion at BLIND, Inc., our rehabilitation center in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Minneapolis</st1:place></st1:City>, of just what help is reasonable
for a person to expect when eating at a buffet restaurant. The bill of fare
offered by this self-service, all-you-can-eat for $5.75 restaurant chain
consists of a salad bar, potatoes, selection of vegetables, breads, several
choices of meats, dessert bar, and beverages. The food is generally excellent.
When you arrive, you stand in line (if there is one) before paying. Then
(picking up your tray, napkin, and silverware) you proceed through your choice
of two food lines. The first question students asked was what help is available
to customers in general at these buffets? There are people making sure the
serving dishes are adequately filled; others are bussing trays and dishes from
the tables; one is slicing and serving meat as people pass through the line;
still others are assisting elderly people and children in carrying their trays
from the line to their tables. Thus, there are several employees available to
provide customer service.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Students
speculated on all the possible areas in which a person who is blind might ask
for help: guidance from the front door, through the line any number of times,
to the restroom, to the table; assistance in buttering bread, cutting meat,
carrying the tray, identifying or serving the food. It is conceivable that one
person could request help in all of these areas. If that were the case, a
restaurant would have difficulty maintaining adequate staff to provide the
needed service while holding costs at a reasonable level. The advantages of a
buffet restaurant are the price, the speed, and the quantity of food available.
The trade-off is having fewer employees to provide service. The question arises
of what problems blindness might present to a person wishing to enjoy the
benefits of a buffet restaurant. Students decided that information was the
central issue. Where does the food line begin? What does a specific serving
dish contain? It is sometimes difficult to recognize the contents by touching
them with a spoon or fork. Where are the vacant tables? We discussed techniques
for carrying the tray while using a white cane and for recognizing various food
textures. The consensus among the students was that, given certain basic
information, which anyone could request, a blind person should be fully capable
of handling all that is required at a buffet. Of course, the way in which the
request is made is also an important factor. Making unreasonable demands is
just as bad as rudely and obnoxiously requiring help or information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
few days after this discussion, three blind people went to a buffet belonging
to the same chain as the two restaurants from which the original caller had
been excluded. They brought no one, blind or sighted, to help. They entered the
restaurant, stood in line with many others, paid, picked up trays and other
utensils, went through the line to get their food, and served themselves.
Occasionally another customer would supply information or answer questions.
From time to time, they were offered help by restaurant personnel. Did they
wish assistance in getting desserts or beverages? (These were in separate lines
from the main food area.) Would they like to have someone carry their trays to
the table? All three made more than one trip to the dessert or beverage line;
some visited the main line for seconds. Information was the only assistance
they needed or accepted. When the three were about to leave, the manager, who
had offered help several times, asked them if this was their first visit to his
restaurant. They said that it was and that they had enjoyed it. They added that
they would come again and would bring their friends. The restaurant employee
replied that he hoped they would.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>From the Editor: Tom Bickford is a frequent contributor to

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
I was ten years old, I didn't care who mowed the lawn as long as it was someone
else. My parents had a different idea about it, so I pushed the lawn mower
around and cut the grass. Yes, that was in the days of the boy-powered lawn
mower, and I felt very much &quot;put upon.&quot; After all, I had two older
sisters living at home, but that was before the days of women's liberation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
I was thirteen, we lived in a different house with a bigger lawn, and, even
though I got paid, I discovered too late that I had underestimated the price I
should have asked. Result: bad feelings. Blindness came along in my late teens.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now that I am the
home owner and feel some pride in home ownership and the appearance of the
yard, things are different. For too many years I didn't think I could really do
the job because I was blind. Then I went to my NFB state convention and heard
Fred Schroeder tell about his experiences mowing his lawn as a blind man. It
was a good story; he told it well; and I knew I had run out of excuses. At this
writing several years later, Fred Schroeder is the Federal Commissioner of the
Rehabilitation Services Administration. Yes, some people, blind or sighted, cut
their own grass, and some people, blind or sighted, get someone else to cut
their grass, but I decided that my time had come.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
principle of mowing the lawn is quite simple: cut a swath. Move over, and cut
another swath. Keep doing that until the job is done. With some practice you
can learn how far to move without either cutting the same space again or
leaving some grass uncut. Anytime I am in doubt, I hold the mower with one hand
to keep the engine running and lean over to feel the area I think I have just
cut. If there is tall grass that I missed, the only thing to do is to move back
and make another pass at it, feel again for assurance, and then go on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
most efficient approach would be to cut long, straight strips which waste less
time in turning around. My trouble is that I don't walk straight for more than
six or eight steps while pushing a mower over slightly uneven ground. The grass
between the sidewalk and curb is just right, ten feet wide and level. That is
the easy part. The hard part is all the rest of it, about five thousand square
feet. That is a moderate amount by suburban standards.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
thing that makes the rest of the lawn hard is this. Even though the lot, the
house, and all the areas covered by concrete are rectangular, there is a
moderate hill along one side, and the house is set at an angle on the lot. In
spite of all the straight lines, the lawn area has a very irregular shape. As
you might expect, there are trees, flower gardens, and other things to bump
into or avoid. I deliberately bump into trees and cut past them from all
directions; then I put one hand on the tree and walk backward around it while
pulling the mower as close to the tree as possible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is a plastic strip marking the edge of the flower gardens which serves two
purposes. It helps to keep the grass from invading the garden area, and I find
that I can slide one foot along the strip as I walk backward while pulling the
mower. With the first pass up against the plastic strip and the next pass a
little farther out as I hold the mower by the corner of the handle, I have
enough space to stand while I cut straight away from the garden. In case you
wonder about my walking backward, I find that I am leading the mower when I go
backward and can direct it better that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since
I have a corner lot at the intersection of two streets, I have plenty of
straight edge along the sidewalk to use as a straight starting edge. I can tell
by feel if the two front wheels of the mower are going onto the grass at the
same time. Then, as my feet come to the edge of the grass, I check again to
make sure I am facing straight in. I walk in six or eight steps and back out as
straight as I can. Sometimes I do move over a bit and try to cut some new grass
on the way back, but I know I may be missing something, so I lean over and
check the cut. Fortunately for me I can reach all the areas of the lawn by
going in six or eight steps from each of the borders. The hill is the worst
part, so I get plenty of exercise by going straight up and holding the mower as
I back down.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>How do I know where I
am? I first learned the shape of the yard while raking leaves in the fall.
Raking covers the same area as mowing. I can hear the rustle of the leaves and
feel the pull of the leaves against the rake, but it is not quite as critical
in spacing as mowing is. With the lawn mower the grass must be very high for me
to hear the swish of the grass as it is cut, but listening over the roar of the
mower engine is one of the least efficient ways to know what I am cutting.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One of the things I
learned about moving over at the inner end of a cut is that, when I turn to
move, I usually leave a small area right at the corner between the two cuts, so
I angle back, go forward to be sure that the cut is square at the top, and then
back out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
I am finished, or think I am, I usually walk along the more critical areas
while leaning over to feel for spots I may have missed. I also usually have a
sighted critic, my wife, check for spots I have missed. If I really did miss
some small area and I didn't know about it, the worst thing that could happen
is that it would keep growing until the next time. I think I would be unlikely
to miss the same spot twice in a row.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

work on your lawn. Happy lawn mowing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

participated in local church activities, helped with cleaning and cooking

hauled as many Braille books home from school as we could fit in the car with

in. My mother cut a pattern out of newspaper, designing it from something else
she had. I pinned the pattern on the material and cut it out. Then my mother
realized that she had forgotten the cap sleeves, so they had to be set in after
all. This made the project more complicated for a beginner, but the gym shirt looked
great to me. I learned to guide the material through the sewing machine using a
quilting guide my mother had. I learned to pin seams and hems closely and
remove the pins just before they came to the presser foot. I learned to move
the gathers on the gathering thread and put them where they should be when I
pinned the gathered piece to the one it needed to be sewed to. Really it wasn't
as hard as I had feared. I wore that gym shirt all through sixth grade. I don't
think we ever got to the shorts.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

darts could be done with pins or basting threads. There were so many different
kinds of darts that it took some practice to get them all figured out.
Gradually I got so I could judge the size of darts pretty accurately without
having to use the marks from the pattern itself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

we came home for Christmas that year, I made a yellow skirt. It turned out all
right too. This time I used the tissue paper pattern. My cutting technique
seemed obvious to me, and my mother never commented on it. Only later did we
learn that blind people weren't supposed to be able to cut around tissue paper
patterns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
held the scissors with my right hand, the way most people do. I looped my left
hand over the top of the scissors with the thumb and fingers opposite each
other right at the part of the scissors that did the cutting. If the edge of
the pattern was at the top of the bottom scissors blade, I could feel tissue
paper on one side and fabric on the other. If the scissors were not right at
the edge of the pattern, I would have paper or fabric on both sides of the
bottom blade. The more practice I got, the better I got, but even as a
beginner, I could cut reasonably well along the edge of the pattern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Patterns
come in an envelope in big sheets, and my mother would cut the pieces apart and
trim them on the cutting lines. She never really read the instructions to me.
Rather she taught me basic concepts about how to set in sleeves, turn down a
skirt band over the seam, set in a zipper, assemble and attach a collar, etc.
She also taught me to identify pieces of garments by their shapes. Sleeves
tended to be round at one end and square at the other. Blouses and dress tops
had big arcs cut out where the sleeves would be attached. The curves at the
front and back of slacks and shorts were shaped differently from sleeve curves.
The curve at the back was bigger than the curve at the front for slacks
patterns, but the curve in the front of the top where sleeves are inset is
bigger than the one at the back.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Much
later I learned that the instructions printed with the patterns could often be
helpful when taking on a new style of garment. I am sure my mother read the
instructions, because she often used them when we were laying out fabric before
we cut it out. But we often found better ways to make efficient use of the
material than the patterns showed. I don't remember what I made during the
summer after my sixth grade year, but I am sure there was something.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
any case, when I enrolled in home economics in seventh grade, I already knew
some of the basics about sewing. Our teacher was new that year and had no
background working with blind girls. Our first project was to make an apron.
There was no cutting. Everything was on a straight line and could be torn with
the grain of the fabric. The aprons had a blue border at the bottom with a
flowered print above. The bands and sashes were straight pieces. The sashes had
to be hemmed, and the aprons had to be gathered and attached to the bands.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
were eight girls in my class, and most of us could sew a hem fairly straight by
the time the aprons were done. The teacher really didn't want us to run a
machine without having her present to watch. I disregarded this instruction
without too much teacher protest.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
learned about the seam guide in that class. You can buy a little metal hump
that screws into the top of the machine cabinet, which works better than my
mother's quilting guide. For the rest of the first semester our home economics
class cooked. Second semester was the real sewing class. My friend and I
decided to make tangerine skirts, but they were different patterns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
teacher's first notion was that she would cut out all the patterns.
Unfortunately for her, I was there to object. So I cut out my own pattern. I
also offered to help other kids learn to do it. Some of the girls really didn't
have much trouble. Some tended to place the fingers of their guiding hand at
the end of the scissors instead of where the cutting occurred. They were
constantly being warned to be careful not to cut themselves. Since I thought
everybody knew better than to close the scissors with fingers between the
blades, these warnings seemed unnecessary. Certainly some of the students were
more fearful of scissors than they needed to be. We also learned how to
assemble all our different patterns.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
I cut out my blouse, I made an error. I should have laid the back on the fold,
but I cut it on the edge of the fabric, thus requiring a seam where there
should have been none. If I had not been so determined to do it myself, the
teacher would doubtless have caught this error before it happened. Some
students were much too cooperative in my judgment and did not do as much of the
work themselves as they could and should have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
could all thread a regular needle using a needle threader with a fine wire
loop. When the wire loop is in the eye of the needle, the thread is brought
through the loop. When the needle threader is removed from the needle, the
thread passes through the eye. Large-eye needles made this easy. Our teacher
encouraged basting, but most of us didn't like to do it. We all learned to
baste, though, because we were required to baste zippers. We also learned to
hem garments with an overcast stitch. It was desirable not to see the thread on
the outside of the hem. With practice, some of us got pretty good at this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Threading
the machines presented another challenge. When threading the machine, one
needed to pass the thread through several metal or plastic loops. No one had trouble
learning where to put the thread, but we would not notice loops of thread that
got caught in other places while we were doing the threading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It took me a while,
but I finally realized that, if I kept the thread taut from spool to needle
while doing the threading, I could tell if there were errors or loops where
they should not be. We always blamed the tension if something went wrong, and I
feel sure that we did inadvertently turn the dial controlling the tension
sometimes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>With
experience I learned to tell from the stitching itself when the top and bobbin
tensions were balanced. My mother was casual about making constructive
suggestions on things like this and more helpful than anyone else before or
since. She would tell me what she looked for, and I could try to learn the same
information by touch. More often than not it worked. Everyone (including me)
tended to rely on somebody's eyesight for certain judgments at first. If a
sighted person wasn't conveniently available to help when wanted, this became a
nuisance and provided motivation for all of us to develop techniques that a
blind person could use independently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is surprising for me now to think about how difficult it sometimes seemed to
feel proper stitching. If we had expected to be able to do it from the
beginning, we all would have found it easier. As it was, this took some time
and experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

clothes during vacations and in home economics. I enjoyed the making and the
wearing of the clothes. I also enjoyed making things for others, but seldom had
enough confidence to do it. I made a shirt for my dad and a baby dress for a
cousin, and I think they were OK.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

college I did not have access to a sewing machine and did very little sewing.
Shortly after I was married, though, a sewing machine seemed important to have.
We bought a cheap one, a portable one that weighed a ton. It was very heavy to
lift on and off the dining room table, so it stayed at one end while we ate at
the other during many weeks. I usually put it away on weekends.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I knew I could save money by making maternity clothes. I did make some, and my

were the big thing in the early '70's, so I took a short course at the YMCA in
stretch and sew. We didn't sew during class. We took our assignments home, so
the teacher had no occasion to worry about blindness. If she didn't explain
something, I asked, but this was easy for all. I made pants and a shirt for my
daughter, who was a toddler, and a matching set for my son, who was a tiny
baby. I also made a shirt for myself. I offered to make my husband a shirt, but
it never got done. It was already cheaper to buy t-shirts than to make them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

assigned to teach sewing along with Braille. My students all wanted to sew with
knits, so the stretch and sew class was far more valuable than I had ever
dreamed. Some of my students were beginners, and some had far more sewing
experience than I. This concerned me at first, but I found that we could learn
from each other in wonderful ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of my students went home and took up sewing a lot. Others did less but enjoyed
it. One young woman had been a professional seamstress in an alterations
department for a big store. She chose to make a jacket that had three parallel
rows of top stitching for trim that were supposed to be done in three different
colors. I cautioned her about this, but that is the kind of thing she liked. I
thought that her control as a newly blinded seamstress might not be as good as
desirable for something that showy, but it really turned out fine. I cannot say
how many students I taught sewing or how many outfits I made for myself and my
children during the next several years, but I gained a lot of experience.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my daughter was in second grade, she joined Bluebirds. They were supposed to
make red felt vests, and none of the mothers wanted to take on this project. I
thought felt vests were not sensible for second graders. One slip of the
scissors would be ugly, and felt was expensive. I offered to have the group make
skirts at my house. Other mothers thought I was crazy, but agreed. It was
simple--use navy blue rectangular pieces of polyester knit fabric. Turn down
the top enough to pull three-quarter inch elastic through. Turn up the bottom
two inches and sew red rickrack around at the top of the hem. Only one seam was
required and no hand sewing. The girls could use the sewing machines if their
mothers would let them. The skirts were cute as they could be, and the girls
were proud as peacocks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the time my daughter was in sixth grade, it was clear to me that she wanted
more clothes than I was willing to buy. I told her she could probably have more
clothes throughout junior high and high school if she would learn to sew. She
was more than eager. She chose to make a three-tiered white skirt with purple
trim. The gathers on three tiers wore her out, so I helped, but she did the
rest. She wore it for her sixth grade graduation and looked great. When she was

Laura was a confirmed sewer, although she still had a lot to learn. We began to
learn about new kinds of patterns together. While she was in high school, she
made casual clothes, but I did the more formal ones. When kids need something
for school, you don't always get much notice. When Laura joined the orchestra,
she needed a black formal. Her friend's mother knew the right pattern, and I
made it. For her first formal dance, I made her a long, mint green satin dress
with puffed sleeves and an inverted &quot;v&quot; below the bust. She had a
good bustline, and the dress looked good on her. She took it to college with
her when the time came. Now Laura does more sewing than I do. She got practice

share this experience with others. It is a way of being creative and busy. One
summer I went looking for clothes and just couldn't find much. Before long I
switched to shopping in fabric stores and had the clothes I liked. Making a
work dress can be done in about the time needed for two shopping trips, and if
shopping isn't going well, sewing is more satisfying. I also can make clothes
fit the way I want them to. If I ever have grandchildren, there will probably

BLIND COUPLE'S STRUGGLE TO ADOPT A BABY</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Nadine Jacobson as told to Bill Holton</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: The following article first appeared in the &quot;Profiles in
Courage&quot; section of the October, 10, 1995, issue of Family Circle
Magazine. Nadine and Steve Jacobson are leaders in the National Federation of
the Blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>.
They are not the first nor, regrettably, will they be the last couple to have
difficulty adopting a child simply because they happen to be blind. But
articles like this one will certainly make a difference in our efforts to
educate the public about this painful and maddening issue. Here is Nadine's
story:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
husband Steve and I were so excited. There was a newborn boy in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arkansas</st1:place></st1:State>, and after
years of hoping and trying, it looked as if we were finally going to become
parents. The private adoption seemed so certain, we started</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>buying baby clothes and furniture for the nursery.
But then, abruptly, the lawyer who was handling the adoption stopped taking our
calls.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm
sorry,&quot; he said when I finally got through to him, &quot;but we changed
our minds and decided to give the baby to another family.&quot; He explained
that it wasn't because there was a problem with our home study or that Steve
and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>couldn't support a child financially. The lawyer
made it perfectly clear there was only one reason we weren't getting that baby
boy--because Steve and I are both blind.</p>

Sweethearts</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Steve
and I have known each other since I was six and he was eight. We were both

 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Academy</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for the Blind, where we pretty much grew up together. We started dating when he
was fourteen and I was twelve. We played in the school band together and sang
in the choir. I was a cheerleader; Steve wrestled on the school team. When
Steve graduated and went on to college, I left the Academy and spent my last
two years in public high</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>school back home in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Richmond</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:State></st1:place>,
where I became involved in speech tournaments, had parts in several school
plays, and graduated near the top of my class. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
were married in the spring of 1973 and set up housekeeping in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Minneapolis</st1:place></st1:City> while I finished college and
Steve started turning his math degree into a career in computers. Like many
couples our age, we always planned on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>having a family but decided to wait, wanting to become
a bit more settled first. Steve went to work for 3M, where today he's a lead
programmer analyst. I got my master's degree in social work, and over the years
I have licensed foster homes, done advocacy work for the elderly, taught
Braille, and done career counseling at a private rehab agency for the blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
ten years ago Steve and I decided it was time to begin our family.
Unfortunately, nature didn't agree. Fertility drugs, making love on a schedule,
many trips to the doctors didn't help. Eventually, I underwent surgery to try
to increase my chances of conception. When even this failed, Steve and I were
forced to face the truth: I was probably never going to get pregnant.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center'>The Adoption
Option </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We'd
talked about adoption many times. It was always something we hoped to do after
we had a baby of our own, but now that it looked like a biological baby wasn't
going to happen. . . .</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Walking
into that first agency interview in June of 1989, Steve and I knew we had a lot
of work ahead of us. Although social workers are educated to understand how the
disabled function and adapt, all too frequently they harbor</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the same misconceptions and negative stereotypes as
does much of the general population. We knew we were going to have to do a lot
of educating, teaching them everything we knew about how blind parents parent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Please,
ask us anything you want to know,&quot; I encouraged the agency officials. They
seemed open to what we had to say and asked a lot of detailed questions. For
example, how would we know if our child were sick or playing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with something that might be dangerous? I explained
to them that, like most parents who don't spend every minute of every day in
the same room with their child, you do a lot of careful listening. If the child
becomes too noisy or too</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>quiet, then you know it's time to check. You become
especially careful not to leave things lying about that a small child could
hurt himself with or put in his mouth.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
as a blind parent you tend to spend more time with your child, sitting on the
edge of the tub or standing right there beside the swing set. And as for
illness, they do make talking thermometers, but what mother can't tell when her
child is sick just by the sound of her breathing or a gentle kiss on an
overheated forehead?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
the following weeks we filled out any number of forms, provided written life
histories and philosophies of parenting and such, and prepared<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>ourselves for that all-important home
visit. Everything seemed to be right on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>track, and Steve and I started to feel cautiously
optimistic.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
the social worker who did the home visit asked how we would feel about adopting
a blind child, we told her that we wouldn't have a problem with it but that, if
we'd had our own baby, he or she wouldn't have been blind, so we didn't think
eyesight should be a consideration. &quot;Yes, well,&quot; she replied
matter-of-factly, &quot;I can't imagine we would even consider placing a
sighted child with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center'>Best Interest
of the Child </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Steve
and I were disappointed by her attitude, but we understood it. In any placement
the agency needs to keep the best interest of the child as its first priority,
and apparently this woman simply did not believe the best interest of a sighted
child could ever be served by placing him with blind parents. Understanding her
position, of course, didn't make it any less misguided. There are thousands of
blind parents raising sighted children and doing a fine job of it. After all,
it's not what you can or can't see that makes you a good parent; it's what you
teach your child about love and life and living in the world. (We</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>later learned of another reason the agency wanted to
limit our adoption to blind children. They were afraid that eighteen years from
now a sighted child might sue them for forcing him to grow up with blind
parents.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
tried to educate them, but it became clear that their minds were set: they
would help us find a child, but it was going to be a blind child.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were
we equally set against adopting a blind child? Of course not. Steve and I don't
think any less of ourselves or each other because we happen to be blind. How
could it make a difference in the way we would feel about a child? But we did
want to adopt a child, and fewer than 1 in 200 children in the world are born
blind. And many of those babies also have severe physical problems that make
them unlikely candidates for adoption.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
had chosen this agency because they specialize in finding children in <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Korea</st1:country-region> and <st1:place w:st="on">South America</st1:place>,
where there are far more babies waiting to be adopted than adoptive parents. We
figured the larger the pool of potential children, the sooner we'd find a baby
who was just right for us. But then the agency tells us that for us the only
right baby is a rare, blind baby.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
rare that, after a year and more of searching, the agency hadn't been able to
come up with a single potentially adoptable child for us.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually
Steve and I began to look elsewhere. We ran up huge phone bills calling other
agencies in other states as well as attorneys who specialize in private
adoptions. There were agencies that would agree to help us, but then</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>we'd never hear from them again. Even though
attorneys were more straightforward, they couldn't help us either. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
the summer of 1992 Steve and I were despairing. And then we were introduced to
a social worker from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Washington</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> named Barbara
Freeman. Barbara and her husband Mike had experienced many of the same
roadblocks to adopting a child as had Steve and I. It had taken them five years
to find a child, particularly discouraging since Barbara wasn't blind; only her
husband was. Barbara told us of an agency in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State> called Hold International Children's
Services, which specialized in placing children with special needs. We</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>contacted them at once. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again
we were asked if we'd mind adopting a blind child. Again we explained that,
blind or sighted, it didn't matter to us--what we wanted was a baby, a precious
new life to love and cherish and raise as our own.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was a few months later, in September of 1992, when we got a call back. &quot;We
think we've found a baby for you. A five-month-old little girl from <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Korea</st1:place></st1:country-region> named
Kang Soo Jee.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Steve
and I tried not to get too excited. We didn't want to get our hopes up, only to
have them dashed again. Sure enough, a few weeks later we got a call. &quot;We
don't think this child is going to work out for you after all,&quot; the woman
apologized. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What's
the problem?&quot; I asked, my stomach tightening into a knot. She explained
that Kang Soo Jee wasn't totally blind, and they were worried that a partially
sighted child might be too much for Steve and me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Back
to square one. I explained to her that I had been partially sighted as a child,
so I knew what it was like. I understood the sort of things Kang Soo Jee needed
to know in order to make the best use of her limited vision and how</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>techniques used by the blind could help her avoid
the dangers of partial- sightedness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
agency representative promised to take what I'd told her under advisement. Six
weeks later we received their decision: Steve and I had been approved for
adoption. Though the waiting wasn't over--there were papers to be filed, a
passport and visa to be secured, and about a million last- minute things that
could go wrong--it began to look as if Steve and I were finally going to get
the baby we'd been praying for.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent align=center style='text-align:center'>The
Homecoming</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
daughter arrived in this country at 1:45 p.m. on March 25, 1993, five days
after my fortieth birthday, and eight days before her very first. &#8220;Oh, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City>!&quot; I wept,
accepting my baby girl from her escort and using the new name we planned to
give her. Steve was right there by my side, a proud new papa.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
was so tiny, so beautiful, and after all these years of wanting and waiting, I
could hardly believe she was really mine.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
she first came to us, she was mostly crawling, and she could only speak a few
words of Korean. Just today she was chasing the cat around the house with one
of the arm protectors from the sofa, calling, &quot;Kitty, night-night!</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Kitty, night-night!&quot; Later, while I was fixing
dinner, she sat on the kitchen floor with most of the pots and pans out,
banging the lids and saying, &quot;`abeth cook too!&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City> loves watching
Barney on TV. She sings along, and when it's time for the &quot;I Love
You&quot; song, she always runs over and gives me a great big hug. After Barney,
we often go to the little park up the street. Sometimes I take</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>her in the stroller with the handle that reverses so
I can pull it with my right hand while I cane with my left, or else I fasten a
loose string tether around our wrists and let her use her own, smaller cane.
She does pretty well with it, too. I stick pretty close to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City> in the playground and usually dress
her in a pair of shoes with tiny bells on the off chance she decides to go
exploring.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
dinner the three of us go for a walk, and <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City>
gets to ride in her daddy's backpack. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City>
loves her daddy. She loves listening to him read to her from one of her picture
books with the text transcribed into Braille, or helping him put together one
of the many puzzles I've Braille-marked on the back so I know which picture
we're working on. I've similarly marked the colors of many of her toys, because
no one is ever going to say my little girl doesn't know green from orange
because both her parents are blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
hope, though, that we'll be able to teach <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City>
more than just the colors of the rainbow or how to read Braille or use her
white cane to negotiate her way across a busy intersection. If Steve and I are
truly to succeed as</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>parents, we're also going to have to impart to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Elizabeth</st1:place></st1:City> everything we
know about growing up to become a decent and responsible human being. We'll
have to show her how to enjoy each day of her life to the fullest and, most
important,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>give her the support and confidence to recognize
that there isn't anything in this whole wide world she can't accomplish if only
she sets her mind to it. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
then, aren't these the very same beliefs, values, and ideals that parents
everywhere hope to instill in their children?</p>

a practicing attorney, an elected member of the city council in her community,
and Second Vice President of the National Federation of the Blind. An obvious
question comes to mind in reading her story, &quot;All In A Day's Work,&quot;
and it is: What on earth does any of this have to do with blindness? The
answer, after a little thought, is equally obvious: everything and nothing. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When

serve on the city council in the City of <st1:City w:st="on">Grinnell</st1:City>,
a town of 9,000 in the quietly beautiful farmland of central <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place

could go on and on about the virtues of our community, but I won't. I'll just
mention a few things we are doing at the moment. I serve on the finance
committee, and we are currently trying to make the budget balance under the
pressure of needs and expectations rising faster than revenues. Our community
has over 30 percent of its land devoted to non-taxable nonprofits, which add
tremendous strength but no tax revenues to the community. We are trying to
balance not only the budget but also the need to invest in the future of jobs
and residents, by spending today's money to increase the income stream while
today's needs for services demand our attention as well. We need more space for
the library and more equipment for streets and snow removal, and the airport
needs a longer runway to accommodate the business jets our growing industrial
base is attracting. We can't do it all. No matter what choices we make, some of
our constituents won't like it. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Speaking
of not liking it, a handful of disgruntled citizens sued me and my fellow
council members when we voted several years ago to sell bonds to do a facelift
of our downtown with new street lights and sidewalk repairs throughout the
central business district.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of our citizens preferred the old, grungy sidewalks and lights so aged we
couldn't even buy parts to the slight increase in taxes the improvements meant.
The suit garnered an unsalable rating for the bonds until it was resolved, and
the momentum for change died. I said to my furious supporters at the time:
&quot;We'll be here longer than they will.&quot; We now have the new street
lights and the smooth sidewalks. And I'm still there. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
about the threat to my life? It came from annexation. I served for quite awhile
as chair of the planning committee. And we annexed in two phases: first a lot
of contiguous businesses and then a different area of residences. Annexation
always raises tempers because taxes are higher inside the city limits for those
who have thus far been benefiting from city services but not helping to pay for
them. The business owners were vocally unhappy, and I lost some supporters for
awhile. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

residential area included a person whose anger reportedly turned to threats. At
a meeting I missed, he slapped the person chairing and controlled the meeting
by shouting and stomping up and down. We all took the reported threats very
seriously since a mayor and two council members had been killed or wounded a
year or so earlier in another small <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>
town by a citizen enraged by a dispute over sewer service. I announced that I

would do as I asked when I asked. He was happy to make the commitment and stood

other is that I as a blind person can serve and serve well. Any deliberative

out of my chair, go out the door, and find something useful to do because I as

others around me so that both they and I can get on with our lives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

accessible through screen readers, Braille displays, and the like although the
graphical user interface (GUI) has been a bit of a setback. A GUI, such as
Microsoft Windows, is a computer operating system which uses those little
icons, a mouse, and bitmapped graphics. It is difficult to translate into

have more to say about technology for the visually impaired, but let me start
with a little story that my parents liked to tell. They were from <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vienna</st1:place></st1:City>, so they liked to
talk about Viennese pastries: Four pastry shops competed on the same street,
eking out a living, but the market demand was not sufficient to support four
shops. So one shop brought in a management expert, and the next morning there
was a small sign in the window, &quot;Best Pastries in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Vienna</st1:place></st1:City>,&quot; and they started to get a lot
of curious pastry shoppers, and pretty soon they had a booming business.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
the second shop brought in their own turnaround consultant, and the next
morning they had a bigger sign in their window, &quot;Best Pastries in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Austria</st1:place></st1:country-region>,&quot;
and they too attracted a lot of curious shoppers. The third shop soon followed
suit with a really big, six-foot-high sign&#8212;&quot;Best Pastries in <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>.&quot; So shoppers flocked to this shop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
the fourth shop owner decided that she needed to do something as well, so the

moral of the story is that you don't have to be the best in the world; you only
have to be the best in your neighborhood, and you have to be in the right
field. In the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vienna</st1:place></st1:City>
of 1930, the right field was pastries. I grew up eating those Viennese
pastries, but I don't eat them anymore, not since my nutrition book came out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of you remember the movie The Graduate; for some of you it may be before your
time. Remember the enigmatic advice that Dustin Hoffman received? (I don't
remember the name of his character.) I remember thinking at the time,
&quot;Plastics?&quot; Even then I thought &quot;computers&quot; would have been
better advice. Today, the advice would be &quot;software.&quot; Some might say
Internet, but in my view that is just another manifestation of software. After
all, NetScape is a software company. You've no doubt noticed the extraordinary
value of software companies. In my view this is not a passing trend; it is not
a bubble that's going to burst, which is not to say that there will never be a
correction or that none of today's high flyers will crash.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
what we are seeing today is a fundamental transformation of the nature of
wealth away from commodities and towards knowledge, as embodied in intellectual
property. In fact, you can draw a reverse exponential curve where the y axis is
the percentage of value of a product represented by natural resources and the x
axis is time, and the percentage of value represented by natural resources is
asymptoting to zero as we go forward in time, and every product and service is
on the curve. Some are closer to zero than others, and some categories of
products are moving faster than others as they travel down the curve, but every
product is on the curve, marching on down to nearly zero contribution from
material resources and nearly 100 percent contribution from intellect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Indeed,
over the past twenty years the value of commodity resources, as measured in
constant dollars, has fallen substantially, about 40 percent, and this trend is
accelerating. So sell short on your natural resource stocks. That is my only
stock tip for today. Today the correct answer to the question of how to advance
economic competitiveness is to foster the creation of intellectual property,
which is information&#8212;that is, sequences of 1's and 0's that have economic
value. And that has not always been the case in human history.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

what is fueling this extraordinary and, in my view, permanent shift to
knowledge, to intellectual property, to software as the foundation of wealth
and power in this second industrial revolution? The answer in my view is <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s Law. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s Law is the
driving force behind a vast revolution. Okay, now what is <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s Law? <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s Law states that computing speeds and
densities double every eighteen months. In other words, every eighteen months
we can buy a computer that is twice as fast and has twice as much memory for
the same cost.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now I won't subject
you again to my chessboard analogy since I think that most of you have heard it
before. If you recall, it concerns the reward that the inventor of chess
receives from the Emperor of China. He gets one grain of rice for the first
square, which is then doubled for each square of the chessboard. And we end up
with a very big number of grains of rice&#8212;about eighteen million trillion
as I recall, which would require rice paddies covering twice the surface area
of the Earth, oceans included.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
actually I've ended up sharing the chessboard analogy with you anyway. That
might remind you of the Presidential debates when Senator Dole said he was not
going to bring up Whitewater and then went on to talk about it anyway. The
chessboard analogy is meant to illustrate the power of exponential growth. What
appears to start out in a subtle fashion ends up being rather overwhelming.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
one might object to the notion of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s
Law continuing for very much longer on the basis that exponential trends cannot
continue indefinitely. For example, if a species happens upon a new habitat,
its numbers will grow exponentially for a time until its needs outstrip the
capacity of that habitat to provide for those needs. But it would be premature
in my view to predict the demise of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s
Law anytime soon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of all, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s
Law is not a recent phenomenon. It has actually been going on for at least one
hundred years from the mechanical card-based computing technology of the 1890
census, to the relay-based computers of the 1940's, to the vacuum tube-based
computers of the 1950's, to the transistor-based machines of the 1960's, to all
of the generations of integrated circuits that we've seen over the past thirty
years.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
you put every calculator and computer for the past 100 years on a logarithmic
chart, it makes an essentially straight line. Actually, it has been going on
even longer than that. In my view, Moore's Law is a corollary of a broader law
I modestly call Kurzweil's law on the exponentially quickening pace of technology
that goes back to the dawn of human history&#8212;I mean, not much happened in,
say, the tenth century, technologically speaking. In the eighteenth century
quite a bit happened. Now we have major paradigm shifts in a few years' time,
but that's another speech.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
you look at the computing technologies currently in development, we can have
confidence in at least several more decades of the turning of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place

explore the third dimension in chip design. Chips today are flat, whereas our

in semiconductor materials, including the development of superconducting
circuits that do not generate heat, will enable the development of chips (I
should say cubes) with thousands of layers of circuitry, which when combined
with far smaller component geometries, will improve computing power by a factor
of many millions. There are more than enough new computing technologies being
developed to assure a continuation of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s

and to harness them on inexpensive platforms. It enables us to live in a world
today in which all of our knowledge, all of our creations, all of our insights,
all of our ideas, our cultural expressions: pictures, movies, art, sound,

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
I would like to examine some of the ways in which technology can contribute in
the future, but before we do that, I think it would be worthwhile reflecting
for a moment on the proper role of technology. The delegates to this conference
hail from two great democratic nations, and perhaps the most important goal of
a democracy is to provide equal opportunity for all of its citizens. To
accomplish the goal of equal opportunity for people with physical and sensory
disabilities, there are in my view three requirements.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The first is
education. Consider the issue of mobility for the blind. A blind person can
travel across town and across the globe as the participation at this conference
attests and as Euclid Herie's travels over the past four days particularly
attest. Despite efforts at creating effective mobility aids, it can be said
that technology has not yet made a contribution to this issue, nor does it need
to. The requirement is education&#8212;in this case mobility training. The
state of the art is a low-tech device&#8212;the modern, lightweight cane,
together with modern mobility training. An effective means of reading and
writing literacy for blind persons is Braille. But Braille needs to be learned,
so again education is the critical requirement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
second requirement is the fostering of positive attitudes, specifically the
attitude that a disability, such as blindness, is a characteristic&#8212;a
characteristic which does not impart limitations on what a person can
accomplish. The positive attitudes needed are both social and personal. Society
needs to understand what its citizens, blind or sighted, can accomplish and
contribute. And an individual needs to appreciate her own capabilities and
reject the negative stereotypes that the deeply ingrained prejudices of society
may attempt to impose.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
won't belabor this issue. One could examine it engagingly at great length. It
is an issue in which we have made great progress, in large part because of the
devoted efforts of people in this room, such as Dr. Jernigan, Dr. Herie, and
all of the organizations represented at this conference.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
just one small example, if you remember, at the last U.S./Canada Technology Conference
almost three years ago, we watched a video of a then current TV show in which
the basic premise was how hilarious it was that the show's blind star was
apparently unable to walk across the room without knocking over numerous lamps,
vases, and other breakable objects. That was considered funny, at least by the
show's producers. That was the entire premise of the show. The show was quickly
canceled, in large part, apparently, because of the strong reaction of people
in this room. Today such a show would be unthinkable, at least on mainstream
TV. But that was not the case three years ago. There's certainly a lot left to
do, but progress is being made.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>And
finally there is technology, which also has a part to play. Technology can also
provide a means for independence, particularly in the area of access to
information and knowledge. Blindness is a sensory disability and therefore
involves access to information. Human intelligence has a great deal of
redundancy, and there are many routes to access information. Technology can
provide a bridge to supply visual information through our other senses. An
obvious example is a reading machine, which provides the information from
printed documents through either spoken words or Braille displays.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So,
using <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s Law
as our road map, let's consider where we are headed in the area of technology
for the disabled. <st1:City w:st="on">Reading</st1:City> machines for the blind
have certainly benefited from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s
Law. I examined this issue recently with regard to reading machines. I have
incidentally started a new company, Kurzweil Educational Systems, Inc. which is
devoted to creating the next generation of reading technology. I've gathered up
some of the best people that I've worked with in this field over the past
twenty-three years, and we have created a new type of reading machine for the
blind, for persons with low vision, and for persons with learning disabilities
and dyslexia.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
recently did a comparison of the first reading machine, the Kurzweil Reading
Machine, which I introduced in 1976, to OMNI 1000, which is my new reading
machine. Without tracking through all the details, the 1996 product provides
about 256 times the performance of the 1976 product, at about one forty-second
of the price, which is a price-performance improvement of 10,752.

aspects of reading machine price and performance in the years ahead. Recently
two-dimensional scanning chips have emerged which can scan a full page of text
with 300-spot-per-inch resolution without any moving parts. These
two-dimensional scanning arrays, which have over 5 million pixels, are
prototypes and are, therefore, expensive. But within a few years these chips
will permit the development of pocket-sized scanners the size of a small camera
that can snap a full page instantly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

within a few years a full print-to-speech reading machine will fit in your
pocket. You'll hold it over the page to be scanned and snap a picture of the
page. All of the electronics and computation will be inside this small
camera-sized device. You'll then listen to the text being read from a small
speaker or earphone. You will also be able to snap a picture and read a poster
on a wall or a street sign or a soup can or someone's ID badge or an appliance
LCD display and many other examples of real-world text.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

reading machine will cost less than a thousand dollars and will ultimately come
down to hundreds of dollars. Algorithmic improvements will also provide
capabilities to describe non-textual material such as graphs and diagrams and
page layouts. These devices will also provide on-line access to knowledge bases
and libraries through wireless connection to the World Wide Web. By the end of
the first decade of the next century, the intelligence of these devices will be
sufficient to provide reasonable descriptions of pictures and real-world
scenes. These devices will also be capable of translating from one language to
another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

scanning sensors of the future reading machine will ultimately become very
small and could be built into a pair of eyeglasses. The advantage of doing this
is that it would allow the user to control the direction of scanning through
motion of the head in the same way that a sighted person does. Once these
devices can provide reasonably intelligent descriptions of real-world scenes,
they will evolve into navigation aids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

will point out that access to the world of print has been a more important
issue than navigation. Braille, of course, is a vitally important technology in
that it provides access to the world of literacy for both reading and writing.
It does, however, have the limitation that only a small percentage of books and
topical literature is available in this alternative medium. Recorded material
has the same limitation. Thus reading machines have provided the opportunity to
overcome a principal handicap associated with the disability of blindness:
access to ordinary print.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a navigation device can provide a level of intelligence sufficient to be truly
helpful, the most useful navigational technology will, as I pointed out earlier,
continue to be the modern lightweight cane. Electronic navigation devices have
already been developed, but they have not yet proved useful. Unless such a
device incorporates a level of intelligence at least comparable to a guide dog,
it is not of much value.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

booths, and other permanent fixtures. It will sound like the buildings are
talking to you, saying something like &quot;I'm the library, and I'm over

enormous flows of data required to process visual information intelligently.

they may as well look in all directions. And they will ultimately have better

deaf, which I believe will be introduced within the next several years. We expect
to introduce a device next year which will be able to understand fully
continuous speech with a large vocabulary. Its primary limitation will be that
you will need to restrict your topic of conversation to a particular domain,
such as medicine or law. It will take several more years before our
large-vocabulary, continuous speech-recognition technology is capable of

stairs. Although federal law now requires most public buildings to accommodate
wheelchair access, the reality is that access to persons in wheelchairs is
still severely restricted. By the end of this decade we will see the first
generation of effective exoskeletal robotic devices, called powered orthotic

narrowly focused intelligent skills, such as the ability to make decisions in
such areas as finance and medicine, and in recognizing patterns such as printed
letters, human speech, blood cells, and land terrain maps. Most computers today
are still idiot savants, capable of processing enormous amounts of information
at very high speed and with great accuracy, but with relatively little

focused deficit of most disabled persons. Our primary strategy in developing
intelligent computer-based technology for sensory and physical aids is for the

I'll leave with a final thought to underscore the revolutionary nature of <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s Law. Another
revolutionary, Mao Tse Tung, said that power comes from the barrel of a gun.
That statement was true when he said it. But he said it in the last possible
decade that one could make that statement because through physical coercion you
could control natural resources. If you could control natural resources and
compel people to labor, you could control wealth. And while not providing the happiest
or most productive workers, it worked well enough.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

second industrial revolution, however, the one that is now in progress, is
based on machines that extend, multiply, and leverage, not our physical, but
our mental abilities. A remarkable aspect of this new technology is that it
uses almost no natural resources. Silicon chips use infinitesimal amounts of
sand and other readily available materials. They use insignificant amounts of
electricity. It's a fortunate truth of human nature that, whereas labor can be
forced, creativity and innovation cannot be.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

there's something else Mao said that is true today, although not in the sense

progress being created through <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moore</st1:place></st1:City>'s

property is a permanent revolution. It's not just that densities of memory

problem is that there aren't really a lot of blind people. Put another way,
there aren't enough blind people to permit economies of scale to come into

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
our field the development and tooling costs for new technologies and products
must always be amortized over a relatively small number of units. Let me give
you some examples. Consider a TV set or VCR for mass markets: development is
spread over many millions of units. There is hardly a consumer electronic
appliance around for which the product development costs cannot be spread over
hundreds of thousands of units. And once the development is complete, the
tooling necessary to allow each individual product to be built at the lowest
possible cost can also be amortized over a large number of production units.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

comparison, one of the most popular electronic devices in our field,
Telesensory's Aladdin video magnifier for people with low vision, involved
about a million dollars in product development cost and nearly another million
dollars in what we call &quot;hard tooling,&quot; to permit the individual
products to be made at the lowest possible cost. We wanted to set a new, lower
price point in the market with a high quality product, and we did so. The basic
Aladdin is priced nearly 20 percent under the Voyager, which it replaced, and
nearly 30 percent lower than the Telesensory Vantage CCTV reading machine,
which it also replaced. It's the lowest price full-featured quality unit on the
market, worldwide; and, to give our customers greater comfort, we also added a
five-year warranty, which is unheard of in most any industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

even so we had to take a considerable risk because, if our startup costs could
not be spread over a fairly large number of units, this would have been a
losing proposition for Telesensory. Fortunately our market planning was
correct, and our unit volume&#8212;the number of units we sold&#8212;jumped 53

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
the area of products for people who are totally blind, especially
Braille-related products, it's even tougher. To sell as many as 500 to 600
units a year of a particular product using Braille output is a challenge to
most manufacturers in this field, and that's a very small number of products
over which development costs and hard tooling can be spread. As a result,
Braille products seem very expensive, and they are!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

can imagine what it would be like if 100,000 Braille displays were being produced
every year, such as the refreshable Braille line displays of the type made by
Telesensory, Alva, Blazie, and a host of European companies. We could expect
costs to drop significantly, probably by at least 50 percent, and perhaps even
more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

likely to remain just a dream, unless someone comes up with a significant
advance in Braille-cell technology. And even that is unlikely, because the
potential volume is not enough to justify the kind of investment which might
produce a low-cost Braille cell. That's what's called a vicious circle, and

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Telesensory
sold around 15,000 of the Speech Plus calculators over a period of a few years.
Then what happened? You know the story: our Japanese friends came out with
talking calculators for the mass market, initially priced under $100, and I
understand you can get some today for prices as low as $29. Perhaps they were
not as well-optimized for the needs of blind people as was the Speech Plus
calculator, but who was going to complain, with that enormous price difference?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What's
going on here? Was Telesensory ripping off its blind consumers? Of course not!
Telesensory's direct internal costs were well in excess of a hundred dollars.
The profit level made on the product was reasonable, not excessive. But
Telesensory did not have the wherewithal or perhaps did not have the means to
attempt to develop a talking calculator which could be sold profitably for less
than a hundred dollars in large volumes to mass markets. As soon as the
Japanese entered the market, Telesensory dropped out. Well that was a success
story for Telesensory for a while, but eventually it had to be abandoned.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let's
look at another example. Ray Kurzweil, whose name is familiar to all of you,
invented reading machines for blind people. Initially they cost $50,000 or
more, well beyond the reach of virtually all blind people, and even
unaffordable to public agencies for individual client use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
years later Xerox acquired Ray Kurzweil's company. Still, almost no reading
machines were sold, despite massive subsidies by the Xerox Foundation to place
machines in various libraries. It was still beyond the reach of the ordinary
blind consumer or even of most rehabilitation agencies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>What
changed this picture? First, ask yourselves the question: why did Xerox buy Ray
Kurzweil's company? Do you think it was because they wanted to enter the field
of products for blind people? Think again. Their motivation, from a business
perspective, was clearly to obtain access to optical character reading
technology for general office use. The product for blind people was an
incidental by-product, which they continued to produce, but in which they have
invested very modest development resources since then. There's not been much
new in that field for quite some number of years, except for a Telesensory
product which I'm going to talk about before I'm through. In fact, Xerox's
adaptive devices division was, according to industry information, on the market
to be sold for quite a period of time, although I don't know whether that's the
case at present. Xerox wasn't a bad corporation because of this&#8212;it just
didn't make business sense for such a large corporation to invest money in such
a low-volume industry.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Even
so, reading machine prices have dropped from $50,000 in Kurzweil's early days
to $5,000 or so for stand-alone systems today and $1,000 for the software alone
to be used with your own PC and scanner.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
we begin to see the answer. We begin to see what it is that can make
technological wonders available to blind people&#8212;and not at a high price,
but at reasonable prices which can be afforded by ordinary consumers, or at
least by the rehabilitation agencies whose mission is to help blind consumers
obtain jobs and lead fuller and more independent lives. The key is the
connection between mass-market technology and the unique needs of blind people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Video
magnifiers, so common today, would not have been possible were it not for the
growth of the market which uses video cameras for inexpensive high-volume
applications, such as security and surveillance in parking lots, office
buildings, and residences, as well as countless other applications. There are
not enough low-vision people to justify the development and production of
low-cost cameras, but by using cameras developed for mass-market applications,
a whole new industry was born in the early 70's.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Similarly,
Ray Kurzweil's invention could never have been made affordable, as it is today,
were it not for the development of personal computers and scanners for mass
markets unrelated to the needs of blind people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Well,
that's great!&quot;, you might say. &quot;So we're just supposed to sit around
and wait for the technological crumbs to fall off the consumer mass-market
table.&quot; That would be a dismaying scenario, if that were the only way we
could hope for truly significant advances in our field, since we would all be
doomed to follow, not lead. In addition, we'd be subject to the problems still
being experienced with, for example, Windows 95 access, where the mass-market
product, Windows 95, just won't work for blind people without significant
adaptation, which remains costly and sometimes inefficient or kludgey.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
is, I think, another approach which developers of products for blind people can
take. That involves tying in other needs&#8212;needs which aren't directly the
needs of blind people&#8212;in order to support the kind of product development
which will nonetheless benefit significant numbers of blind people. For
example, if Telesensory had been able to develop speech technology in such a way
that talking calculators became a desirable appliance for everyone, not just
blind consumers, the cost of talking calculators might have been reduced at an
earlier stage. Unfortunately that didn't happen.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
me give a more pointed example using some of Telesensory's newer products as an
example. Last month, at the Closing the Gap convention in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Minneapolis</st1:place></st1:City>, we conducted private showings of
a new device we call Domino. It's the world's first battery-powered, truly
portable reading machine for blind people, weighing only fourteen to fifteen
pounds and the size of a briefcase. It's lighter, smaller, faster, and easier
to use than Xerox's Reading Edge, which had previously been the closest the
world had seen to a portable reading machine for blind people and, at
twenty-seven pounds or so, not truly portable.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We're putting Domino
on the market at less than $5,000, which is a fair price and less than anything
which is even remotely comparable to it. But even at that price, it won't be a
very profitable product for us, and we need profits to pay for development and
tooling costs, so that we can keep on doing good things.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Are we crazy? No,
we're not crazy. We're just betting again, as we did with Aladdin, that we've
got some ideas which will have applicability in such a way that we can
substantially increase the market base for this product. We want to sell
Domino&#8212;or parts of it, or other products based on some of its unique and
patent-pending technology&#8212;to people who aren't blind for other
applications. If we're successful in doing that&#8212;and, remember I said it's
a bit of a gamble&#8212; then we think we can lower the cost of Domino in the
future so that blind people can benefit immensely.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>This
is an example of what I mean by trying to create crossover applications between
what we do that benefits blind people and finding other applications for the
same products and technology for people who aren't blind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
example of the same concept at work is our recently-introduced Marco (as in
&quot;Marco Polo&quot;). This is an audible-signage navigation system for blind
people. Here there are two parts to the story. First, it's of equal benefit to
people who have low vision. With the much broader audience and market that
provides, we've been able to make a commitment to considerably reduced pricing
for the Marco products, which will benefit blind people as well. The second
major part of this story is that the part of a Marco system which a blind or
low vision person would want to buy&#8212;the receiver&#8212;costs less than
$100. We've designed the system so that the greater part of the cost is in the
transmitter, or audible sign, and that's the part that someone else (a building
owner or transit-system operator) will need to buy and install. This also
operates to hold down the ultimate system cost for the blind user.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally,
there's one other observation I'd like to make. As many of you know,
Telesensory decided, with considerable regret, that the time had come to stop
producing the Optacon, the world's first electronic reading appliance for blind
people. There are many Optacon-lovers who have lobbied for continuation of the
Optacon or some sort of new development to provide the same functions. Deane
Blazie and others are working to see if that can possibly be done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I think this effort,
while commendable for what it tries to accomplish for blind people, is
misguided in the path it takes. The Optacon will never be used by truly large
numbers of people. If one believes, as I do, that resources are finite and
limited and that development funds spent in one place are therefore unavailable
to achieve more in some other place, and that sometimes-difficult choices need
to be made, then the consequence is clear: money spent on low-volume technology
to try to replace the Optacon is money which cannot be spent on other
technological advances which have far greater potential to help blind people.
If small amounts of government funding are used as seed money, perhaps the cost
is moderate. But it still leaves the problem of commercialization, which will
continue to be a costly process in the very small volumes which are likely to
be involved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
conclusion, let me summarize the situation as I see it, regarding the cost of
products for blind people&#8212;and much of this probably applies to other
disabilities as well. There aren't many blind people. Therefore, there's not
much expectation of being able to produce technological advances for them in
the high volumes which are characteristic of consumer appliances. As a result,
both development costs and tooling costs must be amortized over relatively
small unit volumes, which makes the resulting device costs seem to be fairly
high.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
despite that picture, there are areas in which the possibility exists of
adapting mass-market technology for use by blind people, or of developing
devices for blind people which have other uses so that the costs I mentioned
can be spread over much higher unit volumes. And Telesensory certainly hopes to
lead the way in doing just that: better and better applications of technology
to meet the needs of blind and visually impaired people, while driving costs as
low as we possibly can.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Technology, A Blessing Or A Curse?</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Jan Bailey</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: Jan Bailey is one of the leaders of the National Federation of the
Blind of Minnesota. She has recently entered the world of technology and has
lived to tell the tale. Here is her story as she tells it, together with some
hard-won advice for those contemplating this step:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
November, 1992, I was plunged into the world of technology. I work as a
rehabilitation counselor for State Services for the Blind in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>. Our agency had received some
extra money at the end of the fiscal year, and the powers that be decided to
computerize the agency. They also decided to buy technology for blind
employees. I was never consulted about what technology I would need, but nearly
everything imaginable was ordered for me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
two years before I started learning how to use all of this equipment, I had
been urged by several people to ask the agency to buy some adaptive equipment
to help me be more independent on my job. The problem was that I didn't really
know what I would use it for. Several of my computer programmer friends had
told me<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>you should never buy a
computer until you know what you want it to do for you; and, since I didn't
know, I had never done anything about it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
November 10, 1992, my first piece of technology arrived. It was the Braille 'n
Speak. The reason I so clearly remember the date is that we had the next day,
Veterans Day, off. I took the Braille 'n Speak home with me along with the
tutorial tapes and taught myself how to use it. In two days I could create
documents, edit them by inserting and deleting, and use the calculator and
clock. I began entering my client files, phone numbers, addresses, case
dictation, calendar, disability codes, facility fee charges, list of clients by
counties I serve, etc., into the Braille 'n Speak. I soon found it invaluable,
because I'm out of the office a lot, and it was difficult for me to find a good
system for keeping a calendar. I used to write things down on sheets of paper,
and then I would have to search through my notes to find bits of information I
needed. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
everything else I received had been as easy to learn as the Braille 'n Speak, I
would have been in great shape. The Braille Blazer was easy to learn to
operate, but when I entered the world of computers, it was a different story. I
started with the laptop. I knew nothing about a computer. I have a Toshiba
laptop with an Accent speech board and JAWS as the screen review program. The
jack for the speaker kept breaking until someone in our agency's engineering
department adapted it. But this occurred only after months of frustration. When
I started using the computer, I knew nothing about DOS (the Disk Operating
System), so things were very difficult. I took a couple of courses from our
local community education program, and the agency paid for a reader for me. I
felt it would be easier to learn that way, because I was still having trouble
using JAWS, and I knew the instructor at the school wouldn't know how to help
me. I decided it would be easier to learn about DOS and WordPerfect and then
adapt what I had learned for use with JAWS. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next
my<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>desk-top computer was set up. I
have JAWS in that computer as well and use my Braille 'n Speak as a
synthesizer. I also have an eighty-cell Navigator, and I use Braille most of
the time on my desk-top, because I fill out a lot of forms such as plans,
financial inventories, and worksheets to generate authorizations that my
secretary then prepares. I find it much easier to fill in a form by using
Braille. I also have an Arkenstone reader for use with my computer. First I
couldn't get JAWS to talk on the desk-top. Then the card in the scanner was
faulty, and it would short out the computer. Then, when I sent files from my
Braille 'n Speak to the desk-top computer, my computer would lock up and
sometimes short out. It was very frustrating, and there were days I wanted to
throw all my technology right out the window, but I persisted. I also have a
print printer in my office and the Braille translator program Megadots for
translating my documents into Braille to be printed on my Braille Blazer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If it had not been for
my many computer-literate friends who helped me, I never would have learned how
to use all these devices. I still don't know everything there is to know about
them, but I can do the things I need to do. I'm much more independent on my
job. I can read much of my own mail on the scanner and can fill out my own plans
and other forms, so I use much less reader service. But I want to say as
clearly and forcefully as I know how to that without good Braille skills none
of this technology would have done me any good. I needed Braille to take notes
and read the Braille manuals I was given, and I certainly need Braille when my
technology breaks down--and it always does break down, usually when you need it
the most. You have to let yourself rely on the technology, but you still have
to have backup systems for when it breaks down. When you use technology, you
have to be willing to make many phone calls, find solutions to the many
problems you encounter, and spend many hours outside of work studying. There
are getting to be so many different kinds of programs and pieces of equipment
that the technology specialists don't know how to use every program. They can't
keep up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Technology
can be both a blessing and a curse. If one has good basic blindness skills and
then adds technology as the frosting on the cake, it can be a good thing, but
if one uses technology as a<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>substitute for good blindness skills, it will definitely be a curse.
Even though I always carry my Braille 'n Speak in my purse, I also carry a
couple of slates and styluses. If I need to write something down that I want to
study and refer to, I use my slate and stylus, but for some note taking--
especially things I want to save--the Braille 'n Speak is great.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most important
piece of advice I would give to someone just beginning to learn to use
technological aids after obtaining good blindness skills would be to find
several people who can help you when you have problems. Take notes so you don't
have to keep calling them back to ask the same question. Find several people so
you don't have to call the same person all the time. Then, when you've become
reasonably competent using your equipment, try to help others who are just
starting out. I wouldn't go back to the days without technology because I'm</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>definitely more independent on my job, but it's not
a panacea. I would never trade it in for my good blindness skills.</p>

knows that the old technique of starting the plot at the beginning and telling
the story straight through to the end is currently out of favor. Today the plot
advances by jumping from scene to scene and story line to story line; so,
unless one is already familiar with the actors' voices, the program format, or
the plot, the narrative is difficult to follow by sound alone. It is certainly
helpful to watch such programs or films with someone who can identify the
characters and fill in with explanations of inaudible actions. For those who
enjoy such leisure-time activities and who don't usually have someone to
provide occasional explanations, audio description is certainly a convenience. </span></span>In
case you have never run into this invention of contemporary entertainment,
audio description can be broadcast or recorded as part of a program or movie's
audio, or it can be supplied live by a person at an actual performance. The
live description service is usually available using special earphones in a
theater, and only certain performances are described. Those who supply such
services are eager to find new opportunities for providing them in their
communities. And, not surprisingly, those who provide descriptive video for
television and films are also eager to find the funding to expand the number of
movies and programs for which audio description is available.</p>

might do well to consider what the effect on the lives of blind people the
increased availability of audio description is likely to have. This is, in
fact, what the Metro Chapter of the NFB of Minnesota did, and the answer was
disquieting. Peggy Chong, who was President of the chapter at the time, wrote
an article that reported on the experience. It appeared in the Fall, 1997,
issue of the Minnesota Bulletin, the publication of the NFB of Minnesota. This

that the NFB was opposed to audio description. We told her this was not true
but that it was not a high priority for us. We pointed out that the Federation
had made it possible financially for the most recent inaugural ceremonies of
President Clinton to have audio description. We certainly do believe there is
some value in audio description of events, plays, and movies, or we would not

one point she asked if everyone knew what our meeting room looked like. She
went on to describe the room, the ceiling, and the seats. She paused to ask if

where there is no dress rehearsal for her to observe. She replied that she
talks first to the people for whom she is doing the description: what are their
interests, who is important to them? Then, at the event, she makes a point to
get to know the names of as many people as possible at the event so that she can
give accurate descriptions of who is leaving early, for example. In other
words, she goes around to folks and makes it known that she is there to
interpret for the blind guests, who do not know what is going on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

point was that, despite the lack of any professional audio description service,

at the event. This NFB member has had some adjustment-to-blindness training and
knew there were ways to find out why the audience was laughing. He was not
embarrassed or ashamed of his blindness. I am sure there were a few sighted

to ask their neighbors what had happened.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

more than adequate information. Moreover, some people just love to talk and

we certainly hear comments to the effect that theaters should offer audio

to describe what has just happened, but this has not stopped us from enjoying
the play. Countless times sighted playgoers have also asked their companions to
explain what just happened. No one has thrown them out of the theater for
asking. Could it be that the reason blind people are not at many performances
is that we do not yet have the jobs to pay for the tickets? Adding in the cost
of audio description to the tickets will not help to bring in blind patrons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

audio description is an accessory issue. It is not unlike a CD player in your
car stereo. The absence of a CD player in the car does not impede the operation

is not a big step from the idea that audio interpreters are a necessary
accommodation, important to one's understanding and appreciation of a play, to
the conviction that audio interpreters are equally necessary for a blind person
to supervise employees. Actually, if a blind person believes that he or she
needs an interpreter, then the person's real need is adjustment-to-blindness
training. Moreover, anyone with so little self-confidence won't have that or
any job very long. Such thinking places a far greater value on vision as a
technique for learning about the world than any other technique. Those who are
successful in life, both blind and sighted, know that there are many ways,
other than seeing, to learn and enjoy what life has to offer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Editor: Tom Bickford is the author of <i style='mso-bidi-font-style:normal'>Care
and Feeding of the Long White Cane</i>, the NFB's little book of instruction on
effective use of the long cane. He is also a long-time Federationist. We all
have to think carefully about the issues surrounding audible and vibrating
traffic signals. Recently Tom has been thinking about the matter. Here are some
of his thoughts:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText>The best short description I ever heard for a cane used as
a travel aid by a blind person was &quot;a bumper and a probe.&quot; I am sorry
that I have forgotten who said it. Please note: the cane is very low-tech and
still very useful. How about a guide dog? A complicated, interdependent
relationship exists between master and dog, but there are still no electronics.
How about the human brain alone? It is our basic travel tool and is often
considered the most complicated work of nature--but still no electronics.<span
style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Along
with other blind travelers, I recently participated in workshops and
discussions with sighted traffic planners, researchers, and O &amp; M teachers.
The part that seemed strange to me was that, after the studies were presented
and the videos shown, no one talked about how to teach blind travelers to walk
straight or work out requirements to cross a complicated intersection. We, the
blind, need much more to be taught than to be studied.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Once,
when I brought up a point in a discussion, the only solution offered to me was
two more electronic devices. Another time, when I described the technique of
timing the sequence of lights in order to determine when my light was green,
the first response from the travel teachers was, &quot;I wouldn't do
that,&quot; and the second response was a long list of why timing signals would
not work. When I am a student, I do not want to work with a teacher who tells
me that I don't have the ability to count seconds in order to cross a
particular intersection successfully. I want a teacher who will help me develop
and use my abilities in order to make things possible. During one meeting I
attended and after another, guess what was on display: audible, vibro-tactile,
and talking signs for street-crossing aids.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Please
indulge me while I get one of my pet peeves out of the way. Why does the A in
APS (accessible pedestrian signal) have to stand for accessible? Does that mean
that an intersection without one of these devices is inaccessible? If the
inventor had called them alternative, blind people might not have offered so
much opposition.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
may surprise some people to hear me say that I am not totally opposed to
audible or vibro-tactile traffic signals. I believe that at some intersections
there is no other reliable way to know when a light changes. I have used other
intersections at which the audible signal was totally superfluous. High-tech
equipment is expensive to install and complicated to maintain. If traffic
engineers begin installing equipment where it is not necessary or, worse yet,
not used, blind people will come to be resented and considered unworthy, and we
will lose opportunities to receive the access we really need.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
interrupt myself to say that I know how to play word games. You can play
&quot;What If&quot; with me until the cows come home, and I can do the same
with you. First, let us learn to live in the world in which we find ourselves.
There is just no substitute for thoroughly learning and carefully using the
basic techniques of travel with the cane or dog. Just because high-tech has not
caught up with all the places I need to go, I refuse to wait at home until it
arrives. I was recently telling a bus driver that it might be nice when all the
busses were equipped with announcing systems, but in the meantime I had to go
to work every day. Neither of us thought to mention that at that very moment I
was using the low-tech method of asking the driver if my stop was coming up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Nowhere
do these devices give us more than information. It is still our own
responsibility to use that information wisely. I once read an account of a
blind man who heard his electronic device tell him that the light was green, so
he started right across the street. I do not consider that a wise use of
information. We have all had the experience of being kept on the curb during
our green light by a line of cars turning the corner in front of us. We still
have to use our own brains and exercise judgment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
my knowledge there are still no standards for identifying either appropriate
locations for audible signals or the best sounds to be used and for determining
the location of the signal emitters. There is already a controversy over which
intersections are appropriate. Sounds range from music to bird calls to
mechanical noises to human voices. The location of the sound emitters and demand
buttons when they are in use is also open for discussion. As for sounds, I
suggest the principle the quieter, the better. I am glad to note that the
current crop of sound generators is on the quiet side and can alter their
volume according to ambient noise. As for the location of sound emitters and
demand buttons, I suggest that they be right at the curb, at the line for the
crosswalk and away from the corner. Twenty feet back from the crosswalk and
behind a bush are not good places--if the button is going to be at the
intersection, put it right where I can use it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for locator devices, I might have been glad to have them at two locations
during some of our recent national NFB conventions. I refer to locating the
right elevator bank and the right rest room. Let us be frank with ourselves.
They may be low tech, but we put marshals at meeting room doors for purposes of
identification. Can you think of anything that was first scorned, later was
considered a convenience, and eventually became a necessity? What about the
telephone?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
face one real danger as these devices are installed around the country and the
world. The tendency will be to require blind people to use only the places
these devices have been installed and prohibit us from using the places they
have not. Every time that happens, my mobility is restricted, not enhanced. If
it hasn't happened to you yet, it will. You may not recognize the restriction
at first because it will come in the form of a kindness. When riding the <st1:place

want equal opportunity, but I know that the other side of that coin is equal
responsibility. It is hard to get out there and pull my own share of the

pack and to his ice ax so that, as he climbed in front of me, I could follow
him. But, when we left at four in the morning and got up to about 21,000 feet,
this horrendous wind screaming off the Pacific Ocean was blowing straight in
our faces--my finger tips were cold; my feet were cold. I couldn't hear the
bells anymore, and I thought I was going to have to turn back. But Chris was
really smart, and every five minutes or so, knowing I couldn't hear the bells,
he'd put his fingers in his mouth and whistle at the top of his lungs. So for
three or four hours we played this bizarre game of Marco Polo on the mountain. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

I got to the top of the mountain, it was amazing; Itouched this metal cross
that somebody had dragged up there and planted on the top. Though blindness
might have slowed me down in certain situations on the mountain, I try not to
see it as disappointing or sad or tragic. I see my blindness as something that
makes my life an adventure. I know that you folks do the same. Many of you who
are in this city for the first time and try to find a restaurant downtown know
that our lives can be quite an adventure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

embraced this spirit of adventure when I was in high school. I went out looking
for a summer job, and I decided that I could be a dish washer. I went out to a
restaurant and asked for a job, and the person said, &quot;Erik, we'd love to
hire you, but our kitchen is way too small. You'd bump into things; you'd break
things; you wouldn't know how to put things away. We'd love to hire you, but it
would be dangerous, so we can't.&quot; I went to a bigger restaurant with a
really big kitchen this time, and I asked them for a job. They said, &quot;We'd
love to hire you, Erik, but our kitchen is way too big. You wouldn't know where
to put things away. You'd lose your way in the kitchen, and it might be
dangerous.&quot; So I thought, now I can't go wrong. I went to a medium-sized
restaurant with a medium-sized kitchen, and I asked for a job, and they said,
&quot;Erik, we'd love to hire you, but our pots are way too hot; our dishes
come in too fast. You wouldn't be able to keep up.&quot; And I never got a job
that summer, but I did learn something very valuable which has helped me in my
life: people's perceptions of blindness are often more limiting than blindness
itself. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

We got up to a glacier called the Mere Glacier. It was getting really cold. A
storm was coming in, and I was assigned to set up the tents. I had a major
problem because I had never set up this kind of tent before. I had always set
them up with someone else. I found that, when I laid this tent out in front of
me and tried to orient the sleeves and loops and corners of the tent with thick
mountaineering gloves on, I was blind in two ways. I couldn't do it. Finally my
friends had to come bail me out and set the tent up for me. I was frustrated
and embarrassed. Later I went back to Phoenix, where I lived at the time, I
took the tent to a field near my house, and I worked with my thick mountaineering
gloves on, breaking it down and setting it up and breaking it down again. I
could hear cars slowing down looking at this idiot out in the field in
105-degree weather in a tank top and mountaineering gloves, setting up a winter
mountaineering tent. But by the time I got to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType

there is a very blurry line between the things we cannot do and the things we
can do. I've had a lot of fun over these last years as a blind adventurer, sort
of blurring that line even further. In 1995 I had seen a lot of blind people
who had gone skydiving tandem with a person attached to them, but I had seen
only a few go solo, and I really wanted to do that. I found that as a blind

found that I could attach computers to my ears which would beep at certain
altitudes in my helmet. I could attach two radios around my neck with which I
could communicate with a person on the ground. So I could jump just as safely
as anyone else. The first time I actually went solo, though, I had a jump
master in the air and I said, &quot;If I don't hear my computer in my ear,
swoop in and pop me on the helmet.&quot; Well I got something called sensory
overload, which means you forget some of the commands that you've set up
beforehand, and she swooped in because I didn't hear my first computer beep.
She popped me on the helmet. I was so excited to be solo skydiving for the
first time that I popped her back on the helmet. She popped me again, and I
popped her back and said, &quot;Thanks, I'm really having a great time.&quot;
The third time she popped me really hard, I realized what an idiot I was being,

I became blind, I remember seeing this picture of a person climbing a frozen
waterfall. He was a tiny speck against a massive white wall. When I became
blind, I decided that a blind person could learn how to do this, but I was told
by an expert that you can't indiscriminately swing your sharp ice tools (which
attach you to the wall) at the ice face. You'd knock giant chunks of ice off
which would come down and kill you. This is a bad thing in climbing. But I
found through trial and error that I could tap my ice tools very lightly
against the face and by listening for a certain sound, a certain pitch, I would
know whether it was going to be a safe hit or whether it would be a hit that
would shatter ice on top of me. See, people thought you had to be able to see

wanted to climb it an honest way. I didn't want to be a token. I had always
followed a rope so, if I had fallen, I would have just dangled. Now I went out
and learned how to lead. It's called taking the sharp end of the rope. What
enables a team to get up a rock face is that each person takes it in turn to
lead the team up the crack system. Your hands and feet are jammed into cracks,
and you take various sized pieces of metal gear off your harness and jam them
into the crack. As you go a little higher, you take your rope, which is hanging
below your harness, and clip it into those pieces of gear. If you fall, you
hope those pieces of gear will lock against the crack so you won't fall very
far. If you place them incorrectly, you'll fall hundreds of feet, which is
another bad thing in climbing. I learned to lead. I led about a thousand feet,

said, &quot;I'm blind, and I've never actually been on this route before.
There's supposed to be a ledge up there somewhere.&quot; He laughed and climbed

to set up a private practice in your community or the first blind teacher to be
hired in your school district or the first blind person in your college to take
a high-level finance class. In many ways each of us is a pioneer embarking into
uncharted territory. Who understands this philosophy, this pioneering spirit,
better than the National Federation of the Blind? Throughout its history it has
been providing the foundation and leadership for all of us to fulfill our

shatter them. The exciting part is that, when those perceptions are rebuilt,
many, many blind people will find themselves living their lives with greater
opportunity. Part of the fun of climbing for me is that you're roped together.
When you're traveling up a glacier, you have these little holes in the snow
called crevasses. They can be hundreds of feet deep. They can be thirty feet
across. Many times there is just a little frozen snow bridge linking one side
to the other. So roped together, one by one, the team crosses over the bridge.
As each person crosses, the other teammates get ready to throw their ice axes
into the snow to arrest the person if he or she pops through the snow bridge.
It's pretty exciting, but it's scary at the same time. Climbing solo is a really
good way to wind up being frozen in the bottom of a crevasse. We know that
climbing solo on a mountain isn't the best way to cross a glacier. We know as
well that climbing solo is not the best way to improve the lives of blind
people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the Editor: Those who attended the National Convention last July will remember
the electricity that sparked through the hall on Friday morning when Erik
Weihenmayer came to the platform to make his interim report about his
experience climbing Ama Dablam, the mountain beside Everest in Nepal. As Erik
explained to us at the 1999 convention, the purpose of this climb was to enable
the team that will attempt Everest in the spring of 2001 to work together on a
rugged Himalayan climb. They needed to learn about each other and to climb together
in the difficult conditions that characterize the highest mountains in the
world. The climb turned out to provide all the challenge the team could ever
have wished for and then some. But as team leader Pasquale Scaturro told me
following the climb, &quot;After this experience on Ama Dablam I can safely say
that this is the strongest team I have ever climbed with.&quot; Will the team
reach the summit of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Everest</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> next May? There
are no guarantees in the <st1:place w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place>. Certainly
the team's experience with the storms of 2000 on Ama Dablam demonstrates that
Mother Nature and the mountain itself have a great deal to say about who
succeeds in summiting and who does not. But according to Scaturro this team has
a better chance than many of making it to the top of Everest, and Erik will be
an integral part of the effort. What follows is the text of Erik's interim
report to the NFB as he delivered it to the 2000 convention. This is what he

It was exciting. If we really compared our climbing ability, my friend Jeff,
with whom I climbed, is probably a bit better climber than I am. But we topped
out on this rock face, and Jeff's head lamp was broken. Even though Jeff is a
better climber than me by day, guess who was a better climber at night? We had
to get down from this rock face. Just as the last bit of sun was setting on the
mountain, Jeff looked at this book, and it said, &quot;Do not try this descent
in the dark; eight people died last year.&quot; We were in trouble. I had to
lead Jeff out of the mountains. I climbed below him, and I put his feet in
these little holes on the rock face. He made little noises like &quot;AAAH,
AAAH, AAAH!&quot; which I found quite amusing. Then when we got off the rocks,
I kept us on the trail by feeling the packed dirt under my feet, just as I do
during the day. I was a little nervous to be guiding Jeff, but I knew that in

We just got back from Ama Dablam, which was a practice climb. We chose the
spots for these climbs for a couple of reasons. One, because for some reason
when a blind person hangs by his finger tips off an ice face or a thousand feet
off the ground, it gets a lot of attention. Because of that, climbing is a
wonderful platform for talking about blindness, talking about the issues of
blindness--the story of blindness, the wonderful work that the National
Federation of the Blind does--and a platform to make the NFB sort of a
household word among the population at large. As Dr. Maurer put it so well, &quot;To

take yaks for our gear. You can't climb mountains like Everest outright; you
can't just go straight up it. From base camp it'll take us between a month and

they will communicate with me, tell me terrain changes, tell me whether we're

going on bottled oxygen, you cannot communicate in the oxygen mask. It

<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Everest</st1:PlaceName></st1:place> is basically a snow slope, which
takes you to the top with some periodic rock. Ama Dablam is a very steep rock
face. The Sherpa people, who are the local people, call Ama Dablam the mother's
jewel box, because of the mother, the goddess of the <st1:place w:st="on">Himalayas</st1:place>,
and the jewel box, a giant hanging glacier that you have to climb up and over
to summit the peak. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
started out on this trail; it took us about six days to get to base camp. Some
interesting things happened along the way. Number one, my friend Chris and my
other teammates, they hike in front of me wearing a bell--I stick a bear bell
to their pack and one to their ice ax so I can hear them jingling in front of
me. But the yaks going up Ama Dablam and Mt. Everest also have these same kind
of bells jingling from their necks, so the Sherpa people thought we were these
strange yak people from the west because we were jingling along the trail. They
thought it was really strange. They would point and say, &quot;Yak man, yak
man.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

because I have a reasonable amount of skill using my long trekking poles and
hiking and I'm not tripping and stumbling, a lot of the Sherpa people, the
local people of the region, started feeling like I was cheating, like I wasn't
really blind--maybe I could see a little bit, and I was there trying to get
attention or something like that. This rumor got around among the women in the
market place that I could really see, so they waved their hands in front of my
face to test me. I would feel the wind from their hands, so I would flinch, and
they would say, &quot;See that proves it, he can see.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
didn't know what to do. This was becoming a real problem because everyone was
telling me, &quot;We think you can see.&quot; Part of the point was that I was
blind, and I wanted them to know that. So I thought, okay I am reduced to
drastic measures. I didn't know what else to do. I don't want to gross anyone
out, but I lost my eyes a few years back to glaucoma, so guess what I had to do
to prove to the Sherpas that I was actually blind? Well I proved it to him. He
was a little grossed out, but when he left the room, he was thoroughly
convinced. The head Sherpa passed it on to the rest of the Sherpas. He said,
&quot;He is blind; there is no doubt about it.&quot; <o:p></o:p></span></p>

think sometimes as blind people we are reduced to drastic measures to prove to
the sighted world, whether it's in this culture or the Sherpa culture, that,
even though we are blind, we can do the job. We can do it successfully.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When
we got to our base camp at 16,000 feet on Ama Dablam, we started working our
way up the mountain. We had to cross a giant boulder field. The upper mountain
is so steep that rock pours off it, and it creates this giant hodgepodge of
boulders that you have to leap across. There can be big gaps between them.
Sometimes there are boulders up on a ridge where you don't want to fall off the
sides. They are very uneven; there is no rhyme or reason to them. <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boulder</st1:place></st1:City> fields do not
meet Americans-with-Disabilities- Act requirements. It's a blind person's
nightmare for sure. Actually, if I was really mean and I really hated a blind
person, I would stick him in the middle of a boulder field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
had to get across this boulder field. There wasn't any easy way, but we kind of
trudged across it, and we got over it. At 19,000 feet we met the steepest part
of the climb, a vertical thousand-foot rock base, climbing it to almost 21,000
feet with heavy gloves and plastic boots. It was really beautiful climbing. We
got to over 21,000 feet, and at that point we were stopped by weather. The
monsoons were coming in from the south earlier and earlier every day, blasting
us with horizontal snow and huge wind and freezing weather. All the rocks were
piled up with snow, and ice covered over our ropes so it was difficult to
rappel off them. We tried to get a little bit higher. Rocks and ice were
pelting our helmets. It was very dangerous, and we decided this is really a
practice climb. The point isn't to summit this peak--it's to get prepared for <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Mt.</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Everest</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>,

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
came down the mountain. We had to cross down over those vertical sections and
across about a thirty-foot traverse with no footholds that we nicknamed abject
terror, because there's about 5,000 feet of air under your feet, and you are
hanging off these old ropes, and your feet are just slipping on the rocks. It's
really terrifying.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
had spent eight days at 21,000 feet with my friend Eric Alexander. This climb
was being covered by Quokka.com, giving the NFB lots of publicity. When we were
at 19,000 feet, they reported that Eric--and this was true--that one of our
climbers had slipped and fallen 150 feet. That was not me; it was my friend
Eric. Luckily he landed on a tiny ledge. He had on a pack that saved his spine.
He had a helmet that saved his head. It was a real miracle. He climbed his way
back up through slab rocks, and soon after that he went into shock. He got
pulmonary edema, where his lungs filled up with fluid and the oxygen in his
blood went down to forty percent, which is really bad, near death. So Steve
Gipe, our doctor, brought him all the way down through the boulder fields to
base camp. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
the same time, our teammates who were down at camp one climbed all the way back
up the mountain, crossed Abject Terror, and helped us carry loads down the
mountain. About 10:00 o'clock at night, after coming down in this twelve-hour
storm, we all came into base camp together. We met Eric and the doctor down
there. It occurred to me that, if we had summited Ama Dablam in perfect,
beautiful weather, we wouldn't necessarily have proven what we went there to
do, which was to find and prove our strength as a team. But we did, and I think
that meeting such adversity and bad weather on this climb enabled us to find
our strength as a team, to find the very best qualities within us. I saw it as
a very positive training and preparation experience. Eric, by the way, got
helicoptered off the mountain, out of base camp that next day, and he is recovering
safely in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Colorado</st1:place></st1:State>

ready, we'll be honed physically and mentally, and we are accustomed to the
region now and the people. We'll make a really good team as we climb Everest. I
think the most beautiful legacy of this climb will be in the way that we pass
leadership down to other people, especially young people. I have a friend named
Steve Akerman. He's a partial quadriplegic; he pedals his hand cycle, using
just the power of his arms. He pedaled his bike around the world. It took him
almost ten months. He went through eighteen countries. At the end of his ride
he said to a group of people who had gathered to watch him come into
Washington, D.C., &quot;The word encourage is the most powerful word in the English
language--to give people the courage to do great things by our own example of
doing great things.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

think that is so powerful because this climb can go a little way in helping
blind people in particular to live their lives as they see fit, to make their
own rules, to build their own parameters, to shatter perceptions, to blow
through stereotypes, and to throw out the sighted world's expectations and rise
to the level of our own internal potential. If I can be a part of that through
this climb, then I'm very proud. I'm also proud to be part of the National
Federation of the Blind. I think it is appropriate that the NFB, the most
powerful blindness organization in the world, is climbing the highest mountain
in the world--a perfect match. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>PORTRAIT OF AN ARTIST AS A YOUNG GIRL</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Heather Kirkwood</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: Heather Kirkwood is a college student and an active member of the
National Federation of the Blind. Her primary interest is journalism, but she
is also interested in art. It seems clear to me that she must have artistic
ability since she enjoys sketching, drawing cartoons, and painting. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>make this observation because, when I was a child
with some residual vision, no one (least of all me) was interested in or showed
admiration of my artistic endeavors. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Heather
has not found it easy to establish herself as a serious amateur artist. It is
the same old story: either she is dismissed out of hand because of her
blindness, or fellow students are annoyed by her ability because they and the
faculty assume that all sighted art students should certainly produce better
work than she can. Luckily Heather is not easily discouraged, and she has
learned from the Federation the tenacity wherever she is to keep working and
keep educating. Here is what she writes: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
soon as I was old enough to grip a jumbo crayon in my small fingers, my mother
bought a huge roll of newsprint and a set of eight Crayolas. When she was
working in the kitchen, she would spread the newsprint on the floor and lay me
in the middle of it. She placed a crayon in my fist and went about her work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Perhaps this was not the typical approach to
nurturing a blind child, but that is what she did. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I was old enough to attend birthday parties, I would often come home with
coloring books. Within a few days, however, these would disappear. In later
years I learned that my mother was the coloring book thief. She didn't steal my
prizes out of cruelty, but rather out of what she considered kindness. As an
art major in college, she had been taught that coloring books stunted creative
development. She was determined to nurture creativity in her child. Visually
impaired or not, her child would have the chance to grow up to be an artist.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
began the great contradiction of my life. In essence, I was a blind child who
grew up sighted. Although I had been legally blind since birth, no one bothered
to mention to me until the fourth grade that painting and drawing were two
things at which I wasn't supposed to succeed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
this freedom from externally imposed limitations should have been an advantage
to me, often the denial from which it sprang has been a great obstacle. Like
many other legally blind children, I was not told that I might try a white cane
until I was seventeen and was not introduced to Braille until the age of
eighteen. Whenever such things were brought up, the experts, and even my
family, dismissed them. As evidence that I did not require such alternative
techniques, the experts held up my art work as supporting evidence. After all,
shouldn't it be obvious that a child who could draw signs, animals, and even</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>faces in such detail could see where she was going
or what she was reading?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
no one else considered me blind, I never considered myself to be blind either.
I took all sorts of art classes, read art books, and participated in all of the
other things that interested me. This is not to say that no one was aware that
I was visually impaired; I had stacks of eye doctor reports to demonstrate my
very limited visual acuity. It is to say that my lack of vision was considered
a minor fact of my existence.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sounds
great, right? After all, the National Federation of the Blind has long
maintained that blindness is only one of many characteristics of a person, like
having blond hair or brown eyes. The problem was that the other half of the
picture was missing. Blindness can be reduced to the level of a nuisance only
when the proper alternative techniques are mastered. Because my blindness was
considered so minor, I was never taught any of these skills. As a result, I
went through high school with very few large print books, few books on tape,
and no knowledge of Braille. When I had trouble in my German class seeing all
the letters in words that were totally foreign to me, no one offered any help.
In fact, my German teacher remarked that she forgot that I had a vision
problem. When I couldn't see the examples in Algebra and asked the teacher to
write in black, he was less than understanding.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
one was willing to help me work out alternative techniques because no one
understood how much I needed them; not even I was aware of how difficult things
were. I thought it was part of life to spend six hours on homework and go to
bed every night with a headache. That was, after all, the price one paid for
having good grades. When report cards came out, those good grades were held up
as further proof that I didn't need any help. I didn't dispute the status quo
because I assumed that was the way it was.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
sold my art work to pay for my debate trips. Life continued on this<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>course until my senior year. It was not
a change in my vision that caused a gradual change in my understanding of my
situation. Instead, it was reality looking me in the face that scared me
spitless. We were living in <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>,
and I realized that at the end of the year I would have to return to the <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
to go to college alone. I knew I would have to become more independent if this
endeavor was to be successful. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
talked with my mobility teacher, but she seemed to have no adequate answers.
She brought me a long cane (an NFB cane, in fact) and began teaching me to use
it. I thought she had lost her marbles! As I walked down the street, tapping
the cane back and forth on the pavement, I became more worried and frustrated.
I could see the bike rack, the lamp post, the curb, and the street. That wasn't
the problem. The question was, how would this long white cane make me more
self-reliant? When she left, I put the thing behind the wardrobe. It only came
out when I wanted a microphone with which to sing in front of the mirror. I was
not learning to use the cane with sleep shades, so I really wasn't learning to
do anything different. I was still trying to see where I was going.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As time passed, I became more frightened. I supposed
that such fears were normal and went on humoring my mobility teacher in the
hope that I might learn something besides the white cane.In fact I did. I
learned to use landmarks and to read a map. I learned to listen for traffic
patterns and not to be so shy about asking for directions (in German, of
course). Still, in my opinion this was far from adequate. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
winter progressed to spring, I came upon the National Federation of the Blind while
looking for scholarships. Not having a state president to contact in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I
called Joanne Wilson for help. My mobility teacher had known Joanne when she
worked for the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for the Visually
Impaired. While I was talking with Joanne, she invited me to come to <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that summer. In view of my insecurity about leaving
home, I jumped at the chance. Here was a woman who seemed to know what she was
talking about and who had real choices to offer. I really didn't know what I
was getting into, but being a military brat, I adapt to change well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
learned a lot in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>
and should have stayed longer. I learned to use a white cane and read Braille
for the first time. I learned to make great red German cabbage and to use a
computer with ease. In short, I learned to be a blind person.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
people think that blindness is something you are born with,but for many of us
it is something that you learn to come to terms with.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
started out for college with a new-found sense of security about my future.
Ready to take on the world, I walked into Basic Drawing 115--cane, pencil, and
paper in hand. After the first class, I tried to talk to the professor about
certain things. Would he mind if I moved my seat so that I could see the still
life, and could I close the blinds because the light was too bright? He
listened to me with a bewildered look on his face. After I was finished, the
professor sighed and said that he supposed I would be able to draw after a
fashion. I could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>probably express shapes or light and dark. I offered
to let him see some of my work. I knew that this class would be useless if I
could not instill in him any expectation or understanding of my work. I had to
make him understand that I had alternative techniques for doing art work, just
as I had alternative techniques for doing other things. I had not brought a lot
of my art work to college because I did not plan to major in art. But I turned
my room upside down looking for something I could show him and, after a while,
returned with three pieces of my work. One look, and that was the end of that
problem.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
next week I attended the first meeting of the newspaper staff. I was interested
in journalism and wanted to participate. The paper was in need of a cartoonist.
No one volunteered. Instead they hooted and hollered about how they couldn't
draw a stick figure if their lives depended on it. Being a freshman, I was
worried that I might inadvertently step on someone else's turf at the paper.
Timidly I volunteered. The jovial room fell silent. No one knew what to say to
the girl with the white cane. As a result, I was temporarily given the job for
what eventually turned out to be two years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
than the paper, I had no way to display my art work. No one even seemed to know
that I was the cartoonist. That might have been to my advantage since most of
my cartoons were of a political nature, including campus politics. <span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
remained the phantom cartoonist until one day my art professor was defending
the art requirement for graduation at a faculty meeting. He told his colleagues
that I was one of his best students and that, if I could complete the
requirement, any other student should be able to do the same. When I heard
about this comment, I finally understood why I had so few friends in art classes.
If I had demonstrated a lack of talent, I would have conformed to everyone's
expectations. Life would have gone on, but because I displayed talent, suddenly
expectations were raised for everyone else. I realized that I had done a poor
job of educating this professor. He had failed to understand that there is no
necessary relationship between the ability to see well and the ability to draw
or to do anything else for that matter. He was a prisoner of the old stereotype
instead of embracing a new evaluation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
the recent NFB convention I had an opportunity to show my work (excluding my
cartoons) for the first time since beginning college. I can't tell you how much
that chance meant to me. The under side of my bed is not a rewarding audience.
I do not claim to be a Picasso, nor do I even know how my work compares to that
of others. That is not relevant to me. Art is a means of self- expression, not
an exact replica of reality. Cameras can reproduce exact images. I enjoy doing
my art work and am pleased to offer it to other people. But this talent has
caused me trouble because blind people aren't supposed to be able to
communicate a visual experience. I have not put down these stories from an
impulse to brag or to receive recognition, but only to share a lesson. After
all, that is what the NFB is all about.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
what is the moral of my story? As blind people we often fall into the trap of
believing that we must conform to the expectations of sighted people, and,
without questioning, we do so. I can't help wondering how many blind children
have been denied the enjoyment of art for that reason, but the NFB has always
pushed against the outer limits of expectation. I consider that it is a worthy
mission for me to continue to do so even in what is considered to be an<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>exclusively visual realm. I am proud to
be an artist and a member of the National Federation of the Blind.</p>

came to the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Hampshire</st1:place></st1:State>
affiliate's annual convention. She is now working hard to organize a chapter in
<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Keene</st1:place></st1:City> and
reports that the first meeting of the Monadnock chapter of the National
Federation of the Blind of New Hampshire will be held on Sunday, January 12. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Jody is energetic and capable, and she has become an
enthusiastic Federationist. She brings all these traits to everything she does,
including judo--another discipline to which she is deeply committed. She
addressed the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Hampshire</st1:place></st1:State>
convention about her experience with judo. Here in large part is what she had
to say: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
blind woman is traveling alone down a dark, deserted street. There are some
people who might consider her helpless and vulnerable. I would like to change
that image. That blind woman just might be me on my way to teach my judo class.
</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
we all know, the challenges of blindness can be overcome by learning
alternative techniques, but some situations can be a bit more hallenging than
others. As a child in public school, I remember the schoolyard bully, who
tested my vision by punching me in the face. My gym teacher gave me a<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>permanent waiver from class after years
of sitting on the sidelines while the rest of the class played a variety of
ball games. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually
I found a solution to these challenges as well. Judo became my ultimate
alternative technique. When I first heard about judo classes, I was hesitant.
Based on my past experience, I didn't think the judo instructor would consider
me as a student. Happily, I was wrong! The instructor didn't care that I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>couldn't see. He was more interested in what I could
do, and I could do judo. I sincerely mean it when I say that my life hasn't
been the same since that day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is now twenty years
later. Life has come full circle. I am the instructor, and I am recruiting
blind and sighted members to my judo club. I want to give to my students what
judo has given to me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
some other martial arts, judo needs no adaptation for blind players, who have
been active in judo for many years, practicing with sighted players on an equal
basis. For blind children judo can provide an opportunity to be just one of the
kids, both at practice and during club activities. This is as it should be,
because it benefits both the blind and sighted players and embodies the
philosophy of judo as well. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judo
is a full contact form of self-defense that includes throwing techniques, pins,
chokes, and joint-locks. A basic principle of judo is that a small person can
throw a larger by using that person's motion to complete the throw. In this
way, if a person pushes you, you pull him or her into a throw. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
physical benefits of judo practice include self-defense training, weight
control, and physical fitness. With regular practice there is a noticeable
improvement in balance, coordination, and orientation. Judo can be enjoyed by
men and women of all ages from small children to adults. It is a great way to
get back into shape and stay there while having a lot of fun, too. One
enjoyable aspect of judo is that it challenges the mind as well as the body.
Other forms of exercise can be boring, and it is easy to lose interest in them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My students and I have
attended many tournaments and clinics, both large and small, and we have never
been excluded or shown any favoritism. I remember one tournament we attended at
<st1:place w:st="on">West Point</st1:place>. One of the club nstructors wanted
to present my student with the Best Player trophy, based on her blindness. The
tournament director's reaction was to say, &quot;It's no big deal that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>she's blind; I'll give her the Best Player trophy
when she comes here and wins.&quot; She won a lot more than a trophy that day.
On the way home from the tournament she told me that it was the first time in
her life she felt like she was just one of the kids. And for the first time I
began to realize that I was giving back some of what judo had given to me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
is a philosophical benefit to judo training. As you challenge yourself, you
gain a feeling of accomplishment that carries over to all aspects of life. The
knowledge that you can handle a physical conflict makes a verbal conflict much
less threatening. You will find that you develop a strength of mind to stand up
for what you believe in, but also a strength of mind that will allow you to
step back when that is the wise thing to do. You actually become less defensive
and more relaxed. In twenty years it has never been necessary for me to use
judo for self-defense, but I have used the strength of judo every day in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>all types of situations.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part
of this strength comes from a feeling that you are in control. You carry this control
with you in confident body language, in the way you walk and communicate with
people. When you project confidence, you are less likely to be confronted. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
self-confidence that can be gained from judo is very important to children. The
blind child who is frustrated by his or her limitations in ainstreamed gym
classes or who is segregated in classes for disabled students can feel less
capable than classmates. Judo gives the blind child the opportunity to
participate in mainstreamed activity on an equal basis with his or her peers.
When the other kids are talking about their sports and club activities, the
blind child can join in with talk of personal accomplishments. This equality is
important to blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>children, but it is also very important to their
sighted peers as well. The focus is on what you can do, not on what you can't.
It becomes less important that you can't play baseball when there is something
unique you can be proud of. &quot;I can&quot; is the concept that becomes
important.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Self-defense
is important to everyone nowadays, but as blind people we are perceived by some
as more vulnerable than others. Judo gives a balance to this misconception. All
of us should learn to defend ourselves, not just for our own benefit, but as a
means to change society's image of blindness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Self-defense
can be as simple as being sure of who is at your door before you open it, or as
involved as defending your life. You should avoid shortcuts through less
traveled areas and stay in places where there is safety in numbers. Also avoid
walking next to buildings since doorways and alleys are places where someone
might hide. Stay in the center of the sidewalk so that you can be clear on all
sides. When I walk down the street, I try to identify the age, sex, number, and
location of the people around me. This is kind of a game, but it is also a way
of training yourself to be more aware of everything around you, so</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you can anticipate a situation before it develops. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judo
classes are usually taught in a club setting, which includes men, women, and
children of all ages. Judo is often a family activity. There are judo clubs all
over most states. Judo instructors usually teach at no charge. This might seem
surprising, but we enjoy judo, and we teach because we love it. Class fees are usually
minimal and include club dues, a uniform, and United States Judo Association
membership. The United States Judo Association has been very active in
encouraging instructors to recruit blind players, and the instructors are
already familiar with the benefits of judo to blind players.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
you learn judo, your skills and attitude will develop. The school bully will be
less of a threat. You can walk down that deserted street and be a lot less
vulnerable than some might think. Those people who attempt to dominate you will
not be successful. The unsolicited helper who attempts to take you across the
street or the airline employee who attempts to load you into the wheelchair
will both be surprised to find that you are in control of the situation. Judo
is a way to even the odds and change what it means to be blind. I have made
judo my ultimate alternative technique, and I hope you will make it yours as
well.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
hope I have sparked an interest in you to learn judo. It can change your life
as it has changed mine. If you would like more information or if you would like

<h2>Traveling The Globe</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Jennifer Dunnam</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: The following article first appeared in the 1992-93 academic year
edition of the Student Slate, the publication of the National Association of
Blind Students. It is taken from the remarks Jennifer Dunnam made at the 1993
National Conference of Blind Students. Formerly the president of the Louisiana
Association of Blind Students, Ms. Dunnam now serves as the Braille instructor
at BLIND, Inc., in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Minneapolis</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:State></st1:place>. Because she has
learned not to allow blindness to stifle her dreams, Ms. Dunnam has had the
great fortune to travel in a number of countries. Here is what she has to say
about some of her adventures:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
had never understood the true meaning of Murphy's law (anything that can go wrong
will) until last summer when I joined forty-nine other students<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>affiliated with the Arizona Russian
Institute in spending a month studying the Russian language in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">St. Petersburg</st1:City>, <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region></st1:place>. In all of the literature
sent to orient</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>us to the trip, we were repeatedly admonished to
&quot;expect the worst&quot; and &quot;prepare for the unexpected.&quot; On
reading these warnings I tried to think of the worst thing that had happened to
me on a trip and decided it was the time when, at some point during a fifty-mile
bus trip, Greyhound lost a piece of my luggage containing some fairly valuable
items. Unable to come up with a worse scenario which any preparation on my part
could prevent, I distributed the few valuables I planned to take with me among
all of my luggage and did not give the subject another</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thought...until the Friday morning of my intended
departure.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
flight from <st1:City w:st="on">New Orleans</st1:City> to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State> was scheduled to leave at 11:00
a.m., and at 9:00 I was still making last-minute preparations. By the time we
arrived at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">New Orleans</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">International</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
it was twenty minutes to eleven, and we could not find a parking place. Five
minutes later we parked the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>car, grabbed my luggage, and ran to the ticket
counter. I threw my ticket down and listened in utter disbelief as the agent
began telling me that she was so sorry but she could not let me go to the plane
because it was leaving in five minutes. I explained to her that I was
connecting with an international flight, and another would-be passenger on the
flight, who had come running in just behind me, joined me in beseeching her to
hold the plane for us, but it did no good. This particular airline had a
hard-and-fast rule about on-time departures. I tried to work out a later
flight, but there was nothing that would get me into <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State> in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>time to catch the flight to <st1:City w:st="on">Prague</st1:City>,
<st1:country-region w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:country-region>, where I had
an eight-hour lay-over before going on to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St.
  Petersburg</st1:place></st1:City>. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>walked away from the counter, incredulous
that all the months of planning and preparation for this trip seemed about to come
to nothing because I had re-opened my suitcases a few times to include some
last-minute items and accepted one too many phone calls from people wishing me
bon voyage. I hurried to find a pay phone to call the travel agency in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State> which was
handling all of the arrangements for the group. They told me that they would</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>try to work with the Czechoslovakian airline to get
me a seat on the next flight out of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New
  York</st1:place></st1:State>, which would leave the following Monday, but
that I would have to deal with the domestic flight. Needless to say, my relief
was intense until I hung up the phone and hesitated at the implications of what
had just been said. If</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>everything worked out as I hoped it would, I would
be flying alone out of New York into Czechoslovakia, a country where men
carrying large machine-guns were in ample supply--not to mention the fact that
I could say &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; in Czech, but that was about the
extent of my familiarity with the language. To be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>honest, I had no idea how I would handle the
situation. It seemed to me that traveling to and spending time in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> were
challenge enough without this new complication. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
the more I thought about it, the more I began to remember things that I had
hesitated to do in the past and then, having done them, realized how silly it
was for me to have hung back. For instance, I got my first cane when I was
twelve, and at that time it was a big deal for me to walk independently within</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and between the two buildings of the junior high
school I attended. I never went alone to places with which I was unfamiliar; I
never thought it was possible because I didn't know any other blind people who
did such things. My first exposure to the National Federation of the Blind came
when I was fourteen,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and at that point my idea of what independent travel
meant began to change--but ever so gradually. Throughout my high school years I
still often sacrificed opportunities because of my inability to get past
worrying about the details of moving from point A to point B. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
was not until the first time I attended a Washington Seminar in 1988 that I
actually participated in the kind of travel that I had observed blind people
doing at other NFB functions. Not only did these people walk quickly and
gracefully around the hotel and the Capitol, but they walked around the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>whole city, even taking the subway when necessary,
without batting an eye. By the time I went to my first National Convention in
Chicago, I had decided that if all these other blind people could go wherever
they wanted to whenever they</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wanted to, there was no reason why I could not do it
too. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
the fall of 1988 I started my freshman year at <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Tech</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>,
which happened to be within walking distance of the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for the Blind. That gave me plenty of opportunity to interact with and learn
from the staff and students there and to follow their example. I can remember
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thrill I felt the first time I crossed a street
independently and unsupervised. That's something I take for granted now. So in
1990, when I was asked to serve as a chaperon in an exchange program for blind
high school students in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
the idea did not seem nearly as far-fetched as it might have when I was in high
school. I spent two weeks in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Germany</st1:place></st1:country-region>
and found that traveling abroad was something that appealed to me very much.
Having had that experience made it easier for me the following year when I got
a scholarship to study in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for a month during the summer. I traveled there with forty other people from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:place></st1:State>.
In this French language study program there were about</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>six hundred people representing forty-five
countries, and I was amazed by how much easier it is to acquire a language when
one is forced to hear it and speak it all day, every day for a month. I even
went so far as to hire a reader who didn't speak any English.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
my interaction with the people I learned a great deal about French culture. One
of the highlights for me in this respect was the street survey: Each student in
the advanced French classes was given the assignment to choose a topic for
research and ask questions about it of at least ten people on the street. I
decided to try to get some idea of what the citizens of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Angers</st1:place></st1:City> knew and what they thought about
American politics. (As might be expected, I received a wide variety of
responses, from people who were very knowledgeable about the goings-on of
foreign governments to people who in 1991 thought the President of the U.S. was
still Ronald Reagan.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
I stood by that pay phone in the New Orleans airport and thought about how
frightening all this would have been, even three years ago. I decided then and
there that, even though I had no idea what I was going to do about traveling
alone through <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
I would not waste energy worrying about it and would just figure it out as I
went along. Over the weekend I got all the ticket arrangements straightened
out, and on Monday I arrived at the airport well in advance of the departure
time. I made the trip to <st1:country-region w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
via <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Czechoslovakia</st1:place></st1:country-region>
without incident. When I got off the plane in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City>, I found an Avis Rent-a-Car outlet and
ran into some English-speaking people; we ended up going on a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>bus tour of the sites of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Prague</st1:place></st1:City> together. When I arrived at around
midnight in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. Petersburg</st1:place></st1:City>--as
did all my luggage, amazingly enough--I was met at the airport by a driver sent
by the group, and he drove me to the Gostinitsa Gavan, the hotel in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>which the group was staying. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
month was quite an education for me, not only in learning the language, but
also in adapting to a culture which was quite different from that of the other
European countries I had previously visited. For instance, we were advised not
to drink the water from the tap in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St.
  Petersburg</st1:place></st1:City> because of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>risk of contracting giardia. This sometimes caused
some problems for our group because boiled water was difficult to come by with
our limited means, and bottled water was not sold in our hotel, so we had to
travel to another hotel to get it. On about the third day of my stay I suddenly
got extremely thirsty for water. I could not find anyone else in the group who
had a need to go to the Hotel Prebalteskaya at that time, so there was nothing
for me to do but to go there by myself. My ability to speak Russian is now
somewhat better than it was at that point, and all I knew about how to get to
the Prebalteskaya was that I needed to get on the number 40 tram. I took this
basic first step, and then I started trying to ask people how many stops it was
to the Prebalteskaya. By the time I found someone who could understand me and
whose response I could understand, we had long since passed the stop, so I took
a scenic little tour of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">St. Petersburg</st1:place></st1:City></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by tram. But when the stop came around the next
time, I got off and went to get my water. While I was at it, I managed to learn
the word for stamps and bought a couple of those, too. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
weekdays our group's scheduled activities consisted of three hours of class, a
few optional excursions, and lectures. The rest of our time was ours to do with
as we liked, and we were encouraged to make an effort to meet the Russian
people in order to learn as much as we could about the language and culture.
This was not difficult at all, because for the most part people were</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>fascinated by Americans. Usually, when people found
out where I was from, I had an instant invitation to someone's house or out to
a concert, and they almost always wanted to exchange addresses. There was also
the fact that we Americans apparently had the words &quot;I am a tourist&quot;
written all over us, because we were constantly being accosted by black
marketeers trying to sell</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>us anything from watches to military coats to Hard
Rock Cafe T-shirts. These people were easy to make friends with, because most
of them spoke at least a little English. <span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I was on a tour of <st1:City w:st="on">Novgorod</st1:City>, the oldest city in <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region>, I
bought a large dinner bell from a black marketeer who had knife slashes up and
down one of his arms. He told us that he needed the income from his work on the
black market to help support the five other people who lived in a one-room
apartment with him. When we asked him about the cuts on his arm, he said that
every</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>time he got drunk he cut himself; there was about a
two-inch space between the last cut and his wrist. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
saw much evidence of the difficulties of life in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:place></st1:country-region> brought about by the chaotic
economy. Since the average Russian's salary at the time fell about 1,000 rubles
short of meeting basic needs for clothing and food, it was common to see people
in the subway stations trying to sell shoes or books or anything that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>might bring enough income to make ends meet.
However, the people I encountered were always willing to share what little they
had. One man in particular, a nuclear physicist named Zhenya, took us under his
wing. He bought us countless tickets to operas and symphonies (some of which,
incidentally, were canceled with no prior notice). One time a small group of us
took him to a hard</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>currency restaurant for the first Italian food he'd
ever had in his life. We also gave him eight dollars to help him work out an
agreement so he could wait in the hard currency line instead of the ruble line
to put benzine in his car; there was usually only about an hour wait in the
hard currency line, whereas four hours</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was the typical wait in the ruble line. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Zhenya
was very curious about my blindness and how I walked</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>on the streets alone and did the other things the
people in my group did. In addition to numerous discussions on the subject, I
left him with some NFB literature that he seemed to find thought-provoking. And
how did the rest of the people I encountered react to my blindness? Well, there
was the usual tendency to try to force unsolicited assistance on me. At first
this was even more</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>frustrating than usual because I had difficulty communicating
to them politely but effectively that I did not need help. So I talked about
the situation with one of my group leaders, who taught me some pat phrases, and
gradually I learned to use</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>people's over-helpful tendencies in order to
practice my Russian as well as to educate them about blindness. When I told
people that I was studying at the Arizona Russian Institute, they were curious
about the techniques I used to do my classwork. So I told them that I rented a
Cyrillic typewriter that cost ten dollars</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for the month, and I used it to type my assignments
so that the teachers could read them. During class I took Braille notes with a
slate and stylus, and I hired a reader to read homework assignments and tests
to me. Let those who say that blind people need special services and programs
set up before they can have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>access to study in foreign countries take note: I
don't believe a word of it. If a blind person has the basic skills needed to
succeed in college in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">U.S.</st1:place></st1:country-region>,
there's no reason why he or she can't study abroad.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
all comes back to the most important lesson that I have learned and am
continuing to learn through my membership in the National Federation of the
Blind and from my travels in foreign countries: Blindness need not be a
controlling factor in what a person does. It may affect the way in which the
individual does a thing, but it should never prevent someone from doing the
things he or she wants and needs to do. It is a truth that I am coming to
understand more and more as life goes on, and my hope is that every other blind
person will come to understand it and apply it as well.</p>

<h2>My Swim Around <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Key West</st1:City></st1:place></h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Sharon Luka</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: The following article first appeared in the September, 1996, Freestate
News, a publication of the NFB of Kansas. Sharon Luka is a long-time member of
the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kansas</st1:place></st1:State>
affiliate and a staunch Federationist as you will see from her determination to
succeed. Here is her story: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Born
three months premature and blind, Sharon Luka, forty-one, of Saline, <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kansas</st1:place></st1:State>, took up swimming
because she liked the freedom she found in the water. With the support of her
family <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sharon</st1:place></st1:City>
began swimming regularly after college, making real demands on herself. When
you're blind, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sharon</st1:place></st1:City>
says, nobody wants to push you in sports because they don't know what you can
do, and they are afraid you will fail. On Saturday, June 1, 1996, <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Sharon</st1:place></st1:City> competed in the
twentieth annual Swim Around Key West, a grueling 12.5-mile swim at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the southernmost tip of the continental <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sharon,
who was expected to take up to ten hours to complete the swim, finished at
7:57:19. With corporate sponsorship from Pfizer, Inc., <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Sharon</st1:place></st1:City> was the first blind swimmer to compete
in this marathon event and fulfilled her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>goal of proving that blindness is nothing but a
physical nuisance. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
months before I competed in the Swim Around Key West, I had a dream about the
event. It was a nightmare, really, because in it the race had begun, all the
other swimmers were churning up the water, and I couldn't move</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>since I couldn't find the boat that was supposed to
guide me. Luckily, this was one nightmare that did not repeat itself, even on
the eve of the marathon when I had a good case of pre-race jitters. Truth be
told, I had little chance for any sleep, let alone dreams, the night before the
race. All in all, it was a relief to get up and get into the waters of the <st1:place
w:st="on">Gulf of Mexico</st1:place>. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
trained only in a swimming pool, little did I know what I would face that day.
If I had known, I would have stayed in bed and not done battle with tireless
waves, stinging salt, oozing mud flats, clinging seaweed, submerged</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sea walls, and more.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
got my first big surprise when I arrived at the beach and felt a tremendous
gust of wind that practically blew me over. I stood on the shore with 250 other
swimmers, my feet planted in the sand to keep my footing. As waves slammed the
beach, I could hear flags whipping in the air and caught</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>fragments of conversations: &quot;Oh boy, it's
really going to rain.... Looks like hurricane weather.&quot; I made my final
preparations in silence. First, I put on my receiver cap-- the radio-equipped
swim cap that would allow the guides in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my escort boat to act as my eyes during the
marathon. Then I gave my last good-by hug to my sister June, who trembled as we
embraced. I knew she was scared as I headed off toward the wind-tossed waves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Anita
Allen, a marathon swimmer who served as my chief guide in the escort boat, took
my hand, and we started into the water. I plunged forward to get started,
caught a mouthful of water, and choked in surprise. How will I ever</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>begin this race, I wondered, let alone finish it? I
decided right then that, if I could swallow salt water, I could swallow my
pride as well and, rather than swimming out to the starting line on my own, got
towed out by my escort boat to avoid the hazardous surf near shore.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once at the
starting line, I knew I had to get through the next dozen and a half miles all
under my own steam. Navigationally, however, I had to depend on others. My
special receiver cap would enable me to get directions from Anita and be warned
of any obstacles in my path. Since the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>cap is wired for sound, I sometimes use it back home
in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kansas</st1:place></st1:State> to
play music and movie soundtracks when I'm practicing long-distance swims in the
pool. On this day my guide Anita had selections from Peter, Paul, and Mary and
the soundtrack of National Velvet ready just in case I wanted it. But I wound
up too busy dodging waves and trying to breathe without inhaling seawater to
listen to even a single chorus of &quot;Puff the Magic Dragon.&quot; I did
benefit from one bit of movie inspiration: Echoing The Wizard of Oz, Anita kept
spurring me on with &quot;You're not in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Kansas</st1:place></st1:State>
anymore!&quot; True enough, I thought.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
first part of the race was the hardest, because I swam headlong into constant
waves for three miles straight. With no visual clues to help me, I had a hard
time synchronizing my breathing so that my head hit the trough,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>not the peak, of the waves as I inhaled. Throughout
this stretch I kept heading to the left trying to avoid the waves and get air
while Anita kept radioing me to come back to the right.(&quot;You're heading to
<st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cuba</st1:place></st1:country-region>?&quot;)
The best thing I can say about this tug-of-war is that it was so aggravating I
wasn't bored for a moment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Somewhere
along the way, I'll confess, the salt spray started to get to me. By that time
my sinuses were so irritated that my head was buzzing as if I had gotten
nitrous oxide at the dentist. This, I decided, was a situation that urgently
needed help from above. &quot;God, I know that you can stop these waves,&quot;
I prayed. &quot;But if you choose not to, then please just give me the patience
to put up with them.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well
Plan B seemed to suit the Almighty just fine. While the waves and spray kept
coming, I gained not only the patience to put up with them but also the
creativity to turn them into a game. I'd stretch out my arm and try to decide
which side was getting hit harder by rain. This told me which direction the
wind was coming from, and that in turn told me which side to avoid when
inhaling. Certainly not the world's greatest game, but it did keep me busy! </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
irony was that Anita told me I was starting to look like a real ocean racing
pro! But I'm sure I didn't look so great when, about halfway through the race,
I ran into a mud flat. I probably could have walked, not swum, this part of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the route. But since getting up on your feet during
the race is strictly prohibited, I just oozed right on through, wriggling my
way across the smooth silt and seaweed like a tadpole until I hit deeper water
again. The experience was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>surprisingly not unpleasant, but you would surely
have to try it to believe me. The ocean holds many mysteries, even when you
have sharp-eyed guides trying to spot the hazards for you.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
one point, supposedly in clear water, I hit a submerged sea wall and got stung
by a jelly fish or some other creature at the same time. I felt fortunate,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>nonetheless. Since other marathon swimmers got badly
stung all over their bodies that day, I was pretty lucky to get away with just
one tingling spot on my wrist.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The last and
best surprise of the day was that I finished the race sooner than I expected
to; in fact, I completed the 12.5-mile course forty-five minutes faster than it
took me to complete the 9.5-mile swim I'd done in rehearsal. So, when Anita
radioed me that the buoy marking the finish line was just a mile ahead, I
didn't quite believe it. At that point, I felt I could swim forever and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had just one thought in my mind: I'm going to make
it. When I finally touched the giant buoy that marked the end of the race, I
heard a lot of whistling and commotion in the background and thought, &quot;I
wonder what all the excitement</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is. I must really be missing out on something.&quot;
When I got to shore, I found out from my sister that the excitement was me. I
was the last swimmer to finish, and what I'd heard was people cheering me on. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
can honestly say this was one of the happiest momentsof my life. I had trained nine
months for this moment. I had wanted to test my limits and see how far I could
go. Looking back on the experience, I realize how important it was for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>me to prove to myself and other people that being
blind is not a reason to hold back on your dreams. I hope that my experience
will inspire others to challenge themselves.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Believe me,
there is no greater satisfaction than meeting a tough challenge, especially
when it is a tough challenge you have picked for yourself!</p>

<h2>Colleen Roth Sees To It It's A Happier World</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Tom Ensign</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Associate Editor: Like most of us, Colleen Roth has many responsibilities.
She is a wife and mother of a multiply handicapped daughter, who requires a
great deal of attention and supervision. But also like many others in the
National Federation of the Blind, Colleen refuses to limit herself to her
personal life and responsibilities. She finds time to do lots of things in her
community, and her community stretches across the nation. In the April, 1990
Braille Monitor we carried a Monitor Miniature announcing that she had been
chosen as a Jefferson Award winner in the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Toledo</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Ohio</st1:State></st1:place>, area. Subsequently she was
invited to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Washington</st1:City>, <st1:State
 w:st="on">D.C.</st1:State></st1:place> as one of seventy winners from across
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>country to compete for the national award. On Thursday,
May 21, the Toledo Blade ran a story written by Tom Ensign about Colleen Roth
and her many activities. Here is what it had to say:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colleen
Roth spends a lot of time helping people less fortunate than herself. She also
spends a lot of time helping people more fortunate</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>than herself. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
fact, Colleen Roth spends a lot of time helping just about anyone who needs it,
and she dearly loves her work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
must. Here's a quick rundown on just some of her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>volunteer activities: Chairman of the committee on
the multi-handicapped blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of the National Federation of the Blind. First vice
president of the Parents of Blind Children Division in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ohio</st1:place></st1:State>. First vice president of the Toledo
Federation of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Blind. President of Association for Retarded
Citizens in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Wood</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. A volunteer with Family First (a
support group for parents with children with disabilities). A surrogate parent
who acts as advocate for children with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>disabilities who live in foster homes or
institutional settings and don't have parents to speak for them. A volunteer
reader for the Sight Center Audio Network. A licensed respite-care provider (a
specialized baby-sitting service to children with disabilities) in Wood and <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Lucas</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Counties</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
list goes on, and while her activities are impressive, they are particularly
astounding when you consider that Mrs. Roth is blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
only that, her husband <st1:place w:st="on">Dudley</st1:place> is also legally
blind, and their adopted daughter Karen is legally blind and profoundly
retarded.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
would seem enough to keep anyone busy, but these are not handicaps to Mrs.
Roth. In fact, she's not too fond of the work &quot;handicap.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I use the word
&quot;disability,&quot; she says. &quot;We're only handicapped by our attitudes
and those of society. My blindness is a disability, but it is not a handicap.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
Roth has met and overcome some severe adversities in her 38 years. She was born
a premature twin. Six days later her sister died, and Colleen was in an
incubator three months. It was during this time that she became totally blind. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
was reared in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Toledo</st1:place></st1:City>
by her grandmother and was educated</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in Catholic schools. She graduated from <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Ursuline</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">Academy</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> and</p>

  Green</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
she was growing up, she had a fervent interest in helping people and became
involved in volunteer work. She married and had a daughter Monica, who was
visually impaired and mentally retarded. Two years ago, when she was 6, Monica
was killed in a bus accident. &quot;I've never had a feeling of helplessness
that has to do with blindness,&quot; Mrs. Roth says. &quot;I had a feeling of
helplessness</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>when my daughter died.&quot;<span style='mso-tab-count:
1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
might have withdrawn into depression and self-pity, but Mrs. Roth didn't have
the inclination or the time. Last June Karen came to live with the Roths, and
in February they legally adopted the 19-year-old girl. She has provided a light
that was dimmed with Monica's death.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karen
needs total care, and Mrs. Roth fits that in with all the rest of her
activities. Mrs. Roth is quick to praise people who help her out so she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can go out and help others, and she has special
thanks for her friend, Mary Lou Andaverde. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
wouldn't be able to do all the things I do without Mary Lou. She reads and
drives for me. There are lots of mailings, lots of trips to the post office.
She reads the letters to me and just puts in so many hours. She's really an
exceptional woman. I have a lot of material to send out to people, and she does
so much. I can type, but I avoid it when I can because I have rheumatoid
arthritis, and it causes problems with my hands. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;There
are a lot of people who help me in so many ways; you wouldn't believe it.
Sometimes I feel guilty because if it wasn't for all the people in my life who
do things so that I can volunteer, I couldn't do it.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She has a feisty
spirit and says what she thinks whether it's popular or not. For instance, she
does not believe in mainstreaming. &quot;I believe that sometimes a mainstream
setting is actually more restrictive. If the services that a person needs are
not available in a mainstream setting, and the teacher and other people in that
setting object to it, you're not going to get good feedback.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;There
are many who would disagree with that, but I can tell you from my own
experience that it can be very painful being where you are not wanted.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are certainly
many areas where she is wanted, and her volunteer efforts were recognized
recently when she was one of five Toledo-area residents who won a Jefferson
Award for public service.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
local competition was sponsored by WTVG, Toledo Channel 13. She then was
nominated for the national competition and was in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City

<p class=MsoBodyText>From the Editor: Tom Hicks is a fairly new member of the
National Federation of the Blind, but already he has become a leader in the NFB
of Washington. By the time you read this article, Tom will have moved to <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State> to take a new
job. Washington Federationists are deeply saddened to see him go but feel quite
confident that he will become a valuable member of the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
December 6, 1998, I set out to experience my first tandem skydive. This was a
present to myself for recently earning my master's degree in organizational
leadership. I wanted to celebrate it with an unforgettable event. Jumping from
airplanes was not new to me. I was an Army-trained basic paratrooper and have
thirteen high-performance, aircraft static-line jumps under my belt. Still, I
had always heard that skydiving and static line jumping are not the same. I now
know why. I would like to share my high-altitude experience with you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
am legally blind and have a progressive eye disease known as retinitis pigmentosa
(RP). My sight is extremely impaired. I am photophobic and have tunnel vision.
In other words, seeing is not easy for me in most conditions. I am told that
one day I will most likely become totally blind. I take this reality very
seriously, but I do not let it dominate my thoughts or destroy my hopes and
dreams. I may be losing my sight, but I remain a man of great vision. Besides,
a life without challenges is a life not worth living.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
listening to a mandatory safety and disclaimer video on the hazards and joys of
sports parachuting, I signed the necessary documents--in essence, signing my
life away should anything go wrong. I met my jump master, Luke, who helped me
get into my jump suit and harness. He then gave me a fifteen-minute block of
instruction on my actions in the aircraft and air. I listened very closely and
rehearsed the tandem responsibilities in my head. A tandem jump is one in which
one is connected to the harness and parachute of a certified jump master. Luke
had over 5,000 jumps, of which 1,000 were tandem. I sensed he was extremely
confident and capable. This made me feel comfortable. After all, I was trusting
him with my life.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
we walked from the hanger to the aircraft, I could hear three of my five
children, Tommy, Mark, and Ruth, yelling, &quot;Bye Dad.&quot; They were
indifferent to the potential danger of my situation and at ease because I was
not showing any signs of fear. Luke and I were the first to board the small
aircraft. The smell of jet fuel filled the air. The skies were cloudy, and the
air was a crisp forty-two degrees at Kapowsin Airfield. The sights, sounds, and
smells reminded me of my past military parachuting experiences.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
this jump I wasn't alone. Ten of us were packed like sardines in the tiny
aircraft. I heard several skydivers joking and laughing as the plane rolled
down the airstrip and lifted off into the skies over Kapowsin. I wasn't
nervous; however, I was respectful of the situation. I wasn't sure what to
expect. I was excited and at this point totally committed.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the plane climbed higher and higher, I kept thinking &quot;Is this really
happening to me?&quot; It seemed like an out-of-body experience, and I was
somehow just along for the ride. In the aircraft Luke went over what we had
rehearsed on the ground. Next, Luke hooked me up to his harness as I mentally
readied myself to jump. I strapped on my helmet, pulled my goggles over my
eyes, put on my gloves, and gave Luke a thumbs up. The plane leveled off at
13,600 feet, and the exit door opened. The air was cold and roared like a lion.
Luke and I were hunched over as we waddled, connected to each other, toward the
exit door. I gripped my shoulder harness and leaned my head on my right
shoulder while simultaneously standing crouched in the exit door, awaiting
Luke's command to jump. As I stared out the exit door at the passing clouds and
barely visible ground, the air roared in my ears. Suddenly, we leaped out the
door into the wild blue yonder, arching our backs while Luke deployed a tiny
drag chute to help stabilize our rate of descent. The freezing cold air rushed
past us at 120 mph (terminal velocity) as we tumbled toward earth for sixty
seconds of free-fall fun. My elbows and arms floated perpendicular to my body
and acted like wings as we glided through the sky. I gasped for air at first
but then relaxed and was able to breathe normally. I kept thinking, &quot;This
is so cool!&quot; Luke and I steered our bodies toward the cameraman, Andy, who
snapped pictures and videotaped the entire experience. What an adrenaline rush!
Next I felt Luke tap my right shoulder, a signal we had rehearsed on the
ground, to let me know he was about to deploy our main parachute. I quickly
grabbed my shoulder straps just before the chute opened up. Imagine going from
120 mph to about 10 mph: it was like someone unexpectedly slamming on the
brakes in a fast-moving vehicle. Instantly we were jerked to a slow rate of
descent. The roar of the air became quiet and peaceful. We dangled together
under our full canopy at 2,500 feet, enjoying the panoramic view of Kapowsin
below. Luke handed me the toggles and let me steer the chute as we spiraled
toward the drop zone. What a ride! I thanked Luke over and over for the
thrilling experience. But it wasn't over yet. We practiced landing actions and
commands in the air prior to our landing. As we approached the drop zone, we
let up completely on the toggles. This action seemed to increase our forward
speed, then at just the right moment Luke yelled, &quot;Flare!&quot; Together
we pulled the toggles down behind our hips, and I lifted my legs up toward my
chest. This action forced the chute to dip down behind our backs, slowing us
down. Before I knew it, we had landed safely on the ground, but not before
performing an unexpected face plant. Fortunately nobody got hurt, and we stood
up and shook hands. Andy asked, &quot;How was it?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

has taught me to try new things and challenge myself. I am so glad I was able

fresh and positive way. No matter what you undertake in life, push yourself to

Steve Benson led a varied and active childhood. In the following story he
recollects the fun he had playing football with both neighborhood friends and fellow
students. In the first group he was the only blind kid; in the second the whole
group of players were blind. The teams worked out reasonable and fair rules,
and everyone had a good time. Today Steve does public relations and public
education for the National Library Service program in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place

Illinois and a member of the National Federation of the Blind Board of
Directors. This is what he says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Football
was a game I learned to play upon my arrival at the blind school, <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">Alexander</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Graham</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bell</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType>
in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chicago</st1:place></st1:City>. All
the kids who played were blind or legally blind, with one notable exception.
Our version of the game applied National Football League rules to touch
football. Blocking was allowed in this version, which, I learned later, was
neither accepted nor acceptable practice in the touch football game played in
my neighborhood primarily with sighted kids. At <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Bell</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>,
when the ball was put into play, the ball carrier had to call--make some
audible noise. Failure to call resulted in a penalty. In the neighborhood game
that rule was inserted only after I began to play regularly. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
playing field at school was a concrete sidewalk laid out in six foot squares.
At one end of the playing area was a short flight of stairs leading into the
school. The other end of the field was marked by the end of the school
auditorium, which stood on one side of the field.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
playing field at home varied. Sometimes it was an alley with telephone poles as
goal line markers. Sometimes the playing surface was the street with a sewer
cover or parked car or lamp post designated as the goal line marker.
Occasionally we actually played on a park field or in a <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">DePaul</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
parking lot--the latter, of course, when university classes were not in
session.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whatever field we
played on, we seldom had line markers, so mostly there were no first downs. The
offensive team had to cover the length of the field in four downs. Occasionally
a team would punt on fourth down, but more often than not fourth down was a
straight play or a fake punt. The neighborhood games tended to be more wide
open. We usually played with three to five men on a side.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Since the field of
play at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bell</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> was smaller, punts and kick-offs
were thrown, and we played with a large, round inflated rubber ball. The shape
of the ball allowed better control, and the bounce was more true. We used a
standard football in the neighborhood game because the fields were larger and
kicking was allowed. I never mastered the drop kick. I held the ball by one
end, pointed down low in front of me, and kicked away. I guess I was about as
good and about as consistent as most of my peers, which wasn't very good or
consistent.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Whether
at school or in the neighborhood, I played every position but receiver. I
couldn't see the ball to catch it, not even the big rubber ball we used at
school. More often than not I played quarterback in the neighborhood. Receivers
ran down field and called a code word when they were open to receive a pass. I
should point out that we used stop-and-go patterns, slant plays, down-and-out
patterns, and a variety of other plays. Each pattern had its own code words:
colors, animals, street names, and so on. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
field at school was small, and we were all very familiar with all of its quirks
and characteristics. The neighborhood fields presented other challenges. If I
had the opportunity, I would walk the field before starting play. If there were
any unusual obstacles on the playing area, my friends would tell me about them:
holes, puddles, mounds, trenches, cars or other vehicles, etc. Being familiar
with the topography of the field was useful when I was required to execute a
running play or when I played defense and had to chase an opponent. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Recently
I had dinner with two of my childhood friends, Nick and Tom. Nick remembered
one particular play as we reminisced about our childhood games. As quarterback
I dropped back to pass. Nick was open and called for the ball, straight down
the field. I threw; he looked over his right shoulder; the ball went over his
left shoulder, bounced into the street, and was run over by a truck; end of
game. It may have been the longest pass I ever threw, and it was punctuated by
a loud pop.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now
for the notable exception to the practice of all blind kids playing football at
<st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Bell</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. Teachers decided at some point
that it would be a good idea to have an eighth-grade boy participate in our
recess and lunchtime games. So an eighth grade boy, Jim, joined our games. Now
our football games were physical, and the kids often became pretty aggressive.
After the first week of football season Jim bailed out; he said we were too
rough. After he withdrew from the activity, no other sighted student was
assigned. I guess the faculty and administration concluded that we didn't need
a baby sitter, or nobody was willing to take on the challenge of participating
in our fun.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
modifications to football were our own. The techniques that did not work were
abandoned, and we tried new ones. If some technique seemed to give unfair
advantage to one team or another or to kids with a little vision, it too was
rejected. Nobody sustained serious injury, but bumps and bruises were
commonplace. Making our own rules for the competition was as important to us
blind kids as doing so is to sighted kids. We understood the value of it all,
and we had a lot of fun playing, even into our twenties and early thirties in
some cases. Recalling the plays and the funny circumstances surrounding their
execution is probably as much fun now as playing was thirty or more years ago.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

would like to share with all my NFB friends some of my ideas on how I decorate
my cane, but first let me tell you why I decorate it: for holidays, sports
events, parties, and just for fun! I love my cane now. I didn't when I was
little, but now I think even my sighted friends wish they had one. In fact,
some of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my ideas came from them. They're always telling me
what they would do if they had one. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
disguise my cane at Halloween so it will not give me away, and it really adds
to my costume. Last year I won second prize in a contest. I would have won
first, but I didn't have my plastic bananas in time. I was a gorilla, and my
cane was covered with fake green vine. No one knew it was me, and some of the
little</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>kids thought I was a real ape! In the parade I
stopped and pounded on my chest every few feet and made gorilla calls. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
mom said I have to include her rules for me when I decorate my cane so:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>1. Keep the handle clear so I still have a good
grip.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>2. I can't go outside at night with my cane covered
in dark colors.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>3. I have to use my old cane or not damage my good
one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>4. Only do to my cane what I know is safe (and fun).</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'll
start with Christmas because everyone loved my &quot;candy cane,&quot; and it
was my NFB chapter President Mrs. Everlee Dow who said I should share my ideas
with Braille Monitor readers. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
Candy Cane: Start at one end and wrap with red garland or ribbon, leaving
one-inch spaces all the way up. It looks great like that, but you can add a

would put a stress ball on it. You could put Rosary beads or a picture of your
children or family on it. I think that my mom's best idea is getting the
plastic eyes you can buy at the craft store for making stuffed animals and
taping them near the tip of your cane. I think it helps new kids I meet and
even adults understand what a cane is. It explains itself this way and saves me

totally blind, and he recently killed an antelope. It's not the first kill he's
made.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I went to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>
in 1958 as Director of the State Commission for the Blind, I set up shop in a
few small rooms in a former high school building. There wasn't much money, and
there wasn't much staff; but we had enough for a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>beginning. One of the first things we did was to
establish an orientation center. We conducted home-ec classes in the homes of
staff members; we washed pots and pans in an old laundry tub; and we borrowed
and made do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
1959 Legislature gave us the money to buy the old YMCA building in <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Des Moines</st1:place></st1:City>, and we moved
into it in 1960. One of the early students was a fellow named Ted Hart. He
started in the old high school building in 1959, and he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>moved with us to the new quarters in the YMCA. He
stayed until some time in 1960. Shortly thereafter, we helped him get a job at
the John Deere Plant in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Waterloo</st1:place></st1:City>,
and not too long ago he retired with thirty years of service.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It sounds like a
run-of-the-mill story, quickly told and soon forgotten. But wait! There's more
to it than that. Take the time in 1960 shortly after we had moved into the new
facility. I had been out of town, and as I was flying back into <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Des Moines</st1:place></st1:City>, the
passengers on the plane kept talking about the smoke they could see. When we
landed, the news was waiting for me that the smoke was from our new building.
It was on fire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
went as fast as I could get there and stayed the night. It was late afternoon,
and it was already well below freezing. Thousands of gallons of water were
being pumped into the building, and we were facing ruin. How much could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>we salvage? What could we save? All of us, students
and staff alike, pitched in with frantic effort. Throughout the night we moved
furniture and equipment, swept water with broom and mop, and loaded carts and
hunted dry places. One</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of the crew was Ted Hart. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
was not the only dramatic episode during his training. In fact, the day-to-day
building of confidence and the realization that a job and a full life were his
for the taking were far more exciting. And it all came true--a wife, children,
a job, friends, and community involvement. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
was thirty-five years ago. Ted lives in <st1:City w:st="on">Waterloo</st1:City>,

w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Baltimore</st1:place></st1:City>. Our friendship
has continued, but we don't see each other very much on a day-to-day basis--now
and again at a Federation</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>function and once in a while in passing. The old
days at the Iowa Commission for the Blind in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Des Moines</st1:place></st1:City> seem long ago and far away. And
then the other day Ted Robbins of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montana</st1:place></st1:State>
sent me a newspaper article. Here it is: </p>

Every hunter has heard the tales&#8212;some true, some not-so-true--of the
trophy animals to be had under the Big Sky. So when Hart met local guide <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chad</st1:place></st1:country-region></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Schearer last year at an <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State>
sports show, he decided this might be time to try big-game hunting in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montana</st1:place></st1:State>. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
being his first trip to the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Treasure</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>, Hart opted to go
after pronghorn antelope. After a little practice shooting on that Saturday,
Hart and Schearer went after antelope on a ranch near Geraldine on opening day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five hours after they
got started, Hart had bagged a fourteen-inch buck, gutted it, helped carry it
back to the truck, and celebrated a little.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nothing
unusual for sure, until you learn that Hart is blind and has been since the age
of ten. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
Hart's case, however, it was certainly nothing unusual. He carried his own gun,
followed Schearer when they had to move to get a better shot, and, with a
little visual assistance from Schearer, made the shot.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
hunt was made possible because of Hart's customized .30-06 Savage, a willingness
on Schearer's part, and an intense desire by Hart to do all the things he
wants.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm
not going out there, just standing there and shooting away. People just don't
have any idea of what we did to pull this off,&quot; Hart said over lunch at <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Fort</st1:PlaceType> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Benton</st1:PlaceName></st1:place>
cafe. &quot;I wasn't up there slinging lead. If I was going to do that, I'd use
a machine gun,&quot; he said with a gentle laugh. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It's
the old stereotype that blind people are helpless.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's
a stereotype Hart is doing his best to dispel. &quot;I realize it's OK to be a
blind guy--it took me a few years to realize that. All we want is a chance to
be like</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>everyone else. I want the chance to make it or fail
on my own,&quot; Hart said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hart has been creating
his own chances since that day forty-five years ago when he was kicked between
the eyes by a horse. &quot;I was blind before I hit the ground.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
raised a family, worked for John Deere, taught his children to drive, and
taught his boys to hunt. His <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montana</st1:place></st1:State>
antelope hunt was just another opportunity.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;With
me, this antelope hunt was just a matter of fact, this is something I'm going
to do. God made it possible for me to do all these things,&quot; Hart said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On that sunny, windy
day, the hunting gods were certainly good to Hart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They were already in the
field at 7:00 a.m., and there were plenty of antelope around. At one point
there were seventy-five does around the trio. Schearer's father, S.C. Schearer,
joined them to record the hunt on videotape and 35mm film.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;About
11:00 a.m., we saw three does and a buck coming toward us,&quot; Schearer said.
&quot;We skirted around this ridge, but we were still 300 yards away.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With Hart at his side,
Schearer led them closer.Finally peeking over a rocky ridge, they were within
range. &quot;But the buck was eating away from us. Finally he went broadside
and I started giving Ted directions--left, up, right. Then I said, &#8216;On
three, shoot.'</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;One,
two, three--boom. But the shot went right above him. He put in another shell
and boom. I started yelling, `You hit him.'&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;<st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chad</st1:place></st1:country-region> and his
dad started dancing around and cheering,&quot; Hart laughed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It didn't get
exciting for me until I saw the antelope with my hands. That's when it was
real. I was calm when we were shooting. I was doing just exactly what <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chad</st1:place></st1:country-region> was
telling me and nothing else.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
got excited when I could feel it. It was the knowledge that I had done it, that
we really had shot the antelope.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
the two recalled the details of the hunt, Hart burst into laughter when
Schearer urged him to tell about some of the things Hart had &quot;seen&quot;
during the hunt. Apparently, while following Schearer, Hart came across a
cattle calling card.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
had turned around and there was this big, old footprint right in the
middle,&quot; Schearer said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
saw it all right, with my feet,&quot; Hart said. &quot;There was no way it
could have been anything else.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
that is how Hart sees, with all his other senses. &quot;Every part of me is an
eye. It's not the eye that sees, but the brain,&quot; Hart said. &quot;That's
why I had to go down and feel the antelope. It wouldn't have meant a darn thing
if I couldn't go down and see the animal. It would have been as if <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Chad</st1:place></st1:country-region> shot
him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
Hart did more than see the animal. &quot;I walked everywhere we went, I carried
my own gun, I gutted my own animal. I told <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Chad</st1:place></st1:country-region> if I was going to do it, I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was going to do it myself,&quot; he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It
was a normal, guided hunt except he borrowed my eyes to shoot; he did
everything else. He was more of a diehard hunter than a lot of guys I've hunted
with,&quot; Schearer said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;This
put me on the bandwagon that blind people can do as much as a sighted
person,&quot; Schearer said. &quot;I had a lot of outfitters tell me I was
crazy, it</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would take so much extra time, but we were tagged
out in five hours. Ted was out here for the enjoyment of the hunt. A lot of
sighted people think the only successful hunt is if they harvest an
animal.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hart
admits that hunting is not something each blind person can do. But, he added,
he is not unique. &quot;This is not for every blind person, but it's not for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>every sighted person,&quot; Hart said. &quot;But I
should have the right to decide for myself, not have someone make the choice
for me. Society doesn't know what I want.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>How does a blind guy hunt?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Tribune Staff</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
does a blind guy hunt? Chad Schearer and Ted Hart have heard that question
plenty of times. All it takes is a customized rifle, a little practice,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and the patience every hunter requires.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hart
brought a new Savage .30-06 with him for his <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Montana</st1:place></st1:State> antelope hunt. The gun had been
customized by Hart's brother-in-law, Larry Pearson, a gunsmith in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">New London</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Iowa</st1:State></st1:place>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
there was a laser site mounted under the barrel, Hart did not use it for his
hunt. Instead, he and Schearer relied on the 3x-7x scope mounted on a special
bracket and a Harris bipod on the barrel. The bipod provided additional
stability while the two were aiming.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crafted
out of aircraft aluminum, the bracket extends out four inches and them rises
another seven inches. That created an angle that allowed Schearer to look over
Hart's shoulder and give him aiming directions as they lay on the ground.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
would tell him up, down, right, or left,&quot; Schearer said. &quot;We went out
on Saturday so we could shoot together. All those shots hit the target,&quot;
Schearer said. &quot;I had so much confidence after we shot.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hart
said he hopes to return to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Montana</st1:place></st1:State>
next season to go after elk. He would also like to go to <st1:country-region
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Canada</st1:place></st1:country-region> bear
hunting. Then there is bow hunting, another sport Hart wants to try.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Getting
the opportunity is the bottom line for Hart, regardless of the sport or
activity. &quot;It's not a matter of can I or should I, but finding the vehicle
to make it work,&quot; Hart said. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
I read that article, I called Ted on the phone. He hadn't read the story, and
one of his first questions was, &quot;Did they mention the Federation?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When I told him no, he
expressed annoyance and said, &quot;Well, I told them to.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He didn't have much
time to talk to me since he was on his way out the door to attend a meeting of
the Blackhawk County Chapter of the National Federation of the Blind. Incidentally,
he's Chapter President.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ted
tells me that he feels he has had a wonderfully full life and that he looks
forward to the future with joy and enthusiasm. He says that the two things that
have been the most important in helping him succeed have been his Christian
faith and his contact with the National Federation of the Blind. As far as I am
concerned, Ted is a living embodiment of many of the principles we taught in
those early days at the Iowa Commission for the Blind. I took great
satisfaction from my conversation with him. </p>

<h2>Confidence and the Caprine Experience</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Stephanie Pieck</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: Stephanie Pieck (her last name rhymes with deck) is a member of the
National Federation of the Blind of New York. She is young,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>ambitious, and energetic. She also has
an unusual job, or perhaps the proper word is passion. In addition to teaching
English, Spanish, music, and Braille, she raises and shows goats--not just any
goats, prize-winning ones. Blind people are engaged in doing all kinds of
interesting things. Here is Stephanie Pieck to tell</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you something about one of the more unusual ones: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Raising
goats is not what you would consider a typical job--cattle, sheep, or horses
yes; but not goats. And raising goats is certainly not what people would think
of as a feasible job for a blind person. There's too much</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>requiring sight. Of course, there are also people
who dispute these claims; I happen to be one of them. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
took the usual route into goat raising that many youngsters follow: they were a
4-H project. Even before 4-H, my family had them, however, since my brother was
lactose-intolerant. At first we had ten or fifteen goats, maybe</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>twenty in the spring after the kids were born. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
my parents realized that goats weren't just a passing fancy with me, they
helped me register my own farm name with the American Dairy Goat Association,
and in 1987 the first kid was registered with my farm name: Song of Joy Gusto's
Jubilee.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
the following year our family competed for the first time at a national goat
show. It was held in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Harrisburg</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:State></st1:place>, and over two
thousand goats competed. I took part in the youth showmanship contest and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>placed fourteenth in a class of over fifty. As far
as I know, it was the first time a blind person had participated in the event.
Later in the show, which lasts a week, I took part in the Nubian intermediate
doe kid class. Nubians are a specific breed of goat of African and Asian
descent, with long, droopy ears. All the animals at the national show were
does. Intermediate kids were those born between March 1 and April 1. My entry,
Song of Joy Chorus Line, was twenty-first out of seventy-nine contestants.
Again, it was the first time a blind person had actually exhibited her own
animal.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
farm continued to grow slowly over the next several years, and in 1993 I
registered my first LaMancha kids. LaManchas, which are a unique American
breed, have very short external ears, hence the nickname, &quot;earless
goats.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>I went again to the national show that year; it had come back to <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Harrisburg</st1:place></st1:City>. One of my
LaManchas, Song of Praise My Alleluia, was nineteenth in the junior kid class.
(She was born after April 1, so she was put in that category.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And one of my Nubians, Song of Joy HL Arabesque, was
seventeenth in a class of sixty-nine milking does between the ages of two and
three years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
highlight of the 1993 nationals, however, came at about one in the morning of
the fourth day of showing, when one of my Nubians was chosen reserve national
junior champion. In other words, I had the second best non-milking Nubian doe
in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
1994 I was the second blind person to take the American Dairy Goat
Association's (ADGA) Judges' training conference. I missed receiving my license
by one and a half points. I don't count that as discrimination, since I had
very little judging experience, and I was very nervous making my presentations
to the panel. The conference committee asked me to write a proposal about how a
blind person could act as a judge, since some of the requirements (such as
reading tattoos and disqualifying animals with improper markings) cannot be
done without sight. My suggestion: Work with a consulting judge. They do it at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>national shows, so why not at regional ones too?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also
in 1994 I was chosen to serve on the Educational Materials Committee. Since my
selection I have helped the ADGA have its guidebook produced in Braille, and
its quarterly newsletter is now available on cassette.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still in 1994, I took
two animals to the North American International Livestock Exposition in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Louisville</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Kentucky</st1:State></st1:place>.
We did extremely well: my Nubian was third in her class, and the LaMancha was
seventh in hers. I handled both animals and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>received many inquiries about whether or not they
were for sale. The group I was traveling with thought I was crazy since I kept
blankets on the does for the entire trip down and because I gave them beer to
drink when we arrived. They stopped kidding me after several of their animals
got sick from being cold. When they saw my does making tremendous amounts of
milk (while theirs were barely filling their</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>udders), the teasing about beer-drinking goats
stopped too.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
in 1995 I was asked to do a presentation in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Florida</st1:place></st1:State> about how a blind person could
manage to keep goats. I told the director that I would not because such a topic
suggested that keeping goats was an amazing feat for someone who couldn't see.
But I did agree to share with other breeders techniques that don't rely on
sight, such as delivering kids, judging conformation, and diagnosing other
health problems. I used a live animal in my presentation,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and aside from keeping the audience in stitches for
a good part of the discussion--the goat wouldn't be quiet or stand still--many
people told me afterward that they had learned a great deal. One woman who was
losing her sight came up to me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and said that she had gained a lot of confidence
from the things I had said. She had assumed that, when her sight was gone, her
goats would have to leave. Needless to say, I was very glad that in such a
short time I had been able to show it didn't have to happen. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
it comes right down to it, confidence is one of our strongest allies. I have
been told many times that blind people can't show their goats. Some judges have
even placed me last in a class simply because I was blind. Others don't think
blind people can stack hay bales, clean stalls, move grain into storage bins,
or deal with large, aggressive male goats during the breeding season.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
all these people I try to serve as an example. They have seen me handle
300-pound bucks (male goats) that wouldn't allow anyone else to catch them.
They have gotten a good look at the back of my overalls and my goats when they
place behind me in showmanship classes. And they have stood</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>at ringside as several of my does were awarded
permanent championships. Each time they have said, &quot;You can't&quot; to me,
I have answered them with, &quot;Why not?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
1996 the national show is coming to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Springfield</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Illinois</st1:State></st1:place>. Am I going? You bet I
am! I'm already making plans: choosing which animals to breed and when they
will have their kids, saving money to pay for the trip, and dreaming. Everyone
is trying to produce the best goat possible, and my blindness doesn't prevent
me from doing that too. Toward that goal I have bred several of my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>LaMancha does to a buck who has been ranked number
one in the <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">United States</st1:place></st1:country-region>
for the last three years.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
closing I would like to say a word about helpfulness. This story has mostly
been about what I have accomplished and my aspirations for the future. But I
couldn't have achieved any of it without the help of others. In 1993 I started
a newsletter for disabled people with goats. That year I also attended my first
state convention of the NFB of New York. I met many people there who</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>encouraged me to continue what I was doing. I met
even more when I attended the National Convention in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Detroit</st1:place></st1:City> in 1994. To everyone in my family
(Federation and otherwise) I want to extend a huge, heartfelt thank you! And if,
by some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wonderful chance, I come back from <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Illinois</st1:place></st1:State> with another national champion
goat, you will be among the first to hear about it.</p>

<h2>Unusual Hobby: Federationists Have As Much Diversity Aa Others</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: We have often said that the members of the National Federation of
the Blind are a cross section of society, having as much diversity and
difference as the rest of the population. There was a time when the blind, like
other repressed minorities, were constrained to fit a single stereotype--but no</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>more! If you need evidence, we think we can give it
to you in this article.</p>

minding her own business, and as normal as the next person. But she has an
unusual hobby, one about which your editor had no knowledge until he received
the following letter:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dear Dr. Jernigan:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
am enclosing a copy of the article that appeared in last Monday's Wall Street
Journal regarding a rat and mouse show in which I participated as a member of
Northeast Rat and Mouse Club, International. I was not specifically mentioned
in the article, but my rat, Pudgy, who was mentioned, took second place in pet
class.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
of the purposes of the Northeast Rat and Mouse Club, International, is to
promote rats and mice as pets. Any blind person who joins NRMCI will, if he or
she requests, receive our club newsletters on cassette. The club member who
reads the newsletter does an excellent job, describes all pictures, and reads
everything, including the ads. We currently have two</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>chapters, one located in the New York/New Jersey
metropolitan area, and one for people living in <st1:place w:st="on">New
 England</st1:place>, although we have members all over the country and expect
that more chapters will be formed. Even if distance keeps one from
participation in any club activities, the newsletter alone is worth the $15
annual</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>dues. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When I read that letter from Donna, my curiosity was
piqued,so I read the Wall Street Journal article. I think it is worth sharing
with Monitor readers. As you read it, keep in mind that most members of the Rat
and Mouse Club are sighted, that the Club does not discriminate against the
blind, that Club publications are made available to the blind in an accessible
form, and that blind persons vary as widely in their tastes and hobbies as
sighted people do. More power to Donna Maglin and her show rat Pudgy, and
congratulations to Pudgy on his second-place award. Here is the Wall Street
Journal article:</p>

N.J.--Groomed, and powdered, their whiskers aquiver with excitement, some of
the finest rats on the East Coast line up on the judging bench, awaiting what may
be the pinnacle of their show careers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
back yard in the <st1:State w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:State> suburbs may be a

but then, this isn't the Westminster Kennel Club. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's
the fall show sponsored by the Northeast Rat and Mouse Club, a group beguiled
by the rodents that most people love to loathe. Rat fanciers, especially,
confess that until they found the club, theirs was a lonely and more or less
secret passion. &quot;We kind of soft-pedaled it because we didn't want to be
pegged as kooks,&quot; says Elizabeth Fucci, club president. So Easy to Love</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Fucci, a peppy
brunette who keeps 125 rats and 50 mice in her three-room apartment in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Ossining</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">N.Y.</st1:State></st1:place>,
is an ardent rat booster. As pets, she explains, they are both loving and
low-maintenance. &quot;Rats greet you, they interact, they try to please,&quot;
she says. &quot;They are as close to a dog as you're going to get in a
rodent.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
Fucci, who has thinned her colony from an earlier peak of 700 rats and 500
mice, has few illusions about the magnitude of the rat's public relations
problem. Still, club members believe that as the rat comes into its own on the
show bench, the scorn heaped upon animal and owner alike should diminish. Says
Bob Rizzie, the host today: &quot;Shows take the rat out of the sewer and make
it respectable.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fancy
rats--the purebred cousins of the wild rats that scurry along alleyways and
lunch in garbage cans--have been bred and shown in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region> for almost a century. Shows
in this country began about 20 years ago in <st1:place w:st="on">Southern
 California</st1:place>. In 1988, Ms. Fucci and four other fanciers started the
Northeast Rat and Mouse Club. Today, it has about 100 members, divided about
evenly</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>between &quot;ratters&quot; and &quot;mousers,&quot;
as they sometimes call themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The 38 rats being<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>exhibited in Bob Rizzie's backyard are
all <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Norway</st1:place></st1:country-region>
rats. Rarer breeds, such as Rattus rattus, or the roof rat, and the African
giant pouched rat, aren't represented today. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
&quot;fancies&quot; come in a dizzying array of colors and coat types. Besides
the common smooth-coated variety, there are velours, whose coats have the
texture of crushed velour; curly- coated Rexes; and hairless Sphynxes. As for
color, the club's hefty official rule book lists no less than 22 shades,
including apricot and lilac. Marked varieties may be hooded, blazed,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>striped, spotted, masked, or &quot;potpourri.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
classified, animals are scrutinized for conformation to strict standards. Rats
must have full tails--equal to or greater than the body in length; points are
deducted for missing tips. Overlong teeth are faulted. Eyes--black, pink, or
ruby red&#8212;must be large but not bulging; whiskers should be straight and
long-- except in varieties requiring short, curly ones.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Temperament
is crucial, too. Here the rule book is crystal clear: &quot;Any rat which bites
any judge shall be eliminated.&quot; Judges nuzzle the animals to assess their
sociability, and sniff their fur for &quot;off&quot; odors, another serious
fault. &quot;Rats have a sweet natural odor&quot; that smells like sandalwood,
says Ms. Fucci.&quot;If you wore it, people would flock to you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
this show isn't just for the body beautiful. Some rats are entered in the more
democratic &quot;pet&quot; class, an event designed to encourage adoption of
defective animals that might otherwise wind up as snake food--the dread fate to
which pet stores consign culls. Today's entrants include Ms. Fucci's Weebee, a
young male with a wry neck, and Pudgy, a rat born without eyes.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;This
is horrible--I hate doing pets,&quot; mutters judge Roxanne Fitzgerald, a
teacher from <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Los Angeles</st1:place></st1:City>
who is flustered by the lack of firm standards in this category. &quot;When you
see a little face like that looking up, how can you eliminate it?&quot; After
much stewing, she awards top honors to &quot;Dr. Eric Joshua III,&quot; whom
she pronounces a &quot;nice big buck rat--very responsive.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judging
of the main event--rat standards--proceeds after a tense moment in which the
judges search frantically for a missing rat belonging to Ms. Fucci. It turns
out that the rat, Fuzzy Britches, was disqualified at the door when he began
wheezing. &quot;Just a stress reaction,&quot; Ms. Fucci shrugs. &quot;This
happens.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One by one, rats are
eliminated--this one for skittishness, that one for obesity. Judge Gina
Loiacono gives the top prize to Suki, a black and white hooded doe, whom she
holds by the tail, inspecting its underbelly. &quot;No spots on the
groin--that's good,&quot; someone remarks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Suki's
owner, Eileen Brown of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Trevose</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">Pa.</st1:State></st1:place>, has 25 rats. &quot;I like
their temperament--so gentle,&quot; she says, kissing Suki on the nose. Her
husband isn't as smitten, but Mrs. Brown says he tells her, &quot;If it keeps
you sane, go ahead.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To break the tension
of the day-long affair, rat races are held during lunch. Bob Rizzie has
constructed a wooden track complete with a sliding starting gate. Grouped in
heats, the contenders run down the track, coaxed along by their owners, known
as &quot;jockeys.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
two-dozen spectators cheer as Mr. Rizzie's rat Molly and Ms. Fucci's Weebee
compete in the final heat. It's no contest. Molly dawdles at the gate, while
Weebee--after a detour to gnaw on a wooden strut--sprints across the finish
line. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;He
was born to it,&quot; Ms. Fucci crows, clutching Weebee's golden, winged
trophy. She says that Weebee has been in training for months, tirelessly
running laps on her bed, where he sleeps. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
much-awaited &quot;Best in Show&quot; event, judged by Ms. Fucci, pits the top
rat--Mrs. Brown's Suki--against three mice: winners of the English mouse,
American mouse, and Egyptian spiny mouse categories. The trophy goes to
Harlequin, a black satin roan mouse owned by Wanda Wilson of New<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>umberland, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Pa.</st1:place></st1:State> &quot;He epitomizes the American
standard,&quot; Ms. Fucci declares, as Harlequin perches atop its 18-inch
trophy. Suki places second.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Today's
show, all agree, is a model of efficiency and decorum compared with previous
events, which were somewhat fractious affairs plagued by delays, rule disputes
and, in at least one instance, a narrow brush with flying fur. A TV crew
completely disrupted one show, Ms. Fucci recalls indignantly, by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>trying to &quot;stage a showdown between a
neighborhood cat and an exhibitor's beloved pet rat.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Club
members grow weary of defending their hobby. Wanda Wilson, whose article,
&quot;I'm OK, You're OK,&quot; appeared recently in the club's bimonthly
journal, writes of her relief at finding kindred spirits in the club who are
&quot;so reassuringly sane&quot; and who don't bore her, as other friends do,
with chatter about</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>baseball scores, star charts, and high-fiber diets. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
all, baseball scores don't come when called (rats respond to their names) or
have endearing, humanlike ways. Ms.Fucci is charmed by the way her domesticated
rats wet their hands in their water bottles, carefully shake off the excess,
and wash their faces. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Yet,
humans tend to fear the rat, and club members offer lots of theories that
address this. Some trace it to the plagues of the Middle Ages, and the wild
rat's reputation for spreading disease. Others think it all boils down to
the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>nimal's long, hairless tail.
For Bob Rizzie, it's the name itself. &quot;Just the word turns people
off,&quot; he says. Not much help are lurid newspaper accounts of jumbo
&quot;killer&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rats stalking the subways. But club members are
quick to draw a distinction between their pampered pets and rats in the wild.
&quot;Wild rats probably deserve the bad rap they get,&quot; concedes Ms.
Loiacono, a <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Manhattan</st1:place></st1:City>
artist. &quot;It's like the<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>ifference
between a pet dog and a wild dog.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
Liz Fucci, who spends eight hours a week cleaning out 62 cages of rats and
mice, wouldn't tolerate an invasion of her home by a street-wise rodent.
&quot;I'd have no qualms about [trapping] it,&quot; she says. &quot;A sewer rat
is an absolute no-no&#8212;you don't know where it's been. I'd have to protect
my own colonies from disease, even if it meant killing a wild rat to do
it.&quot;</p>

<h2>Some Suggestions On How To Use Readers More Effectively</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Jerry Whittle</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: Developing good study habits and using readers effectively are
important skills for any blind student to master. From time to time we have
published articles on this important subject. (See &quot;The Care and Feeding
of Readers&quot; by Peggy Pinder in the May, 1993, issue and &quot;Of Readers,
Drivers, and Responsibility&quot; by Peggy Elliott and Barbara Cheadle in the
March, 1995, issue.) Jerry Whittle is a staff member at the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for the Blind. He has worked with many students and has personal experience
supervising readers successfully. His approach is a little different from that
of Peggy Pinder Elliott, but his message is the same. This is what he says:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
the past ten years the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for the Blind has
had several students who had never used readers before and who sought to be
more effective in their study habits. Usually I discover that these students
have been making some fundamental errors in using their readers efficiently.
First of all many blind college students make the mistake of hiring only one or
two readers, usually college students attending the same institution as the
blind person. One or two readers are not enough. Tests at a university often occur
on roughly the same schedule in all classes; therefore, student readers need to
study for their own tests, so they are unable to spend lots of time helping the
blind student during these high-pressure periods in the school year. If,
however, the blind student maintains a list of seven or eight dependable
readers, the chances of finding someone to help study in times of crisis are
far greater. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
principle in using readers is not to hire university students only. It is
important to hire one or two readers who do not attend college. At exam time
all college students are necessarily engrossed in their own studies and do not
have much time to help a blind employer. A reader from outside the university
becomes extremely important in such times of concentrated study.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is essential that the time you spend with your readers be effectively used.
Some students make the error of relying on their readers to record tapes only.
During my undergraduate and postgraduate work, I rarely asked readers</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to tape record anything for me and drop it off. I
did this for several reasons. First of all, when one allows a reader to work on
his or her own recognizance, he or she is less likely to be efficient than when
reading directly to the employer. Tapes often come back with innumerable yawns
or recorded by a voice that sounds as though the reader were an inmate of a
concentration camp. This happens because readers often get around to recording
the material only when their</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>own studies are finished and they are ready for bed.
</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
tapes can break, twist into frightful knots, or become garbled. Third, no two
tape recorders are alike, so the reader may well use a K-Mart special to
produce tapes that will be irritating or incomprehensible on your top-of-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the-line tape recorder. Fourth, human nature being
what it is, readers often do not get study materials recorded until the very
last minute. Often anxiously awaited tapes don't appear at all because the
reader has not been under the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind employer's direct supervision. In short,
reader laziness and irresponsibility can be a terrible problem, and they are
more likely to occur when one sends a reader home with material to record
rather than doing it live and under</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>direct supervision.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
blind students also make some rather tragic mistakes when using a reader under
direct supervision. For example, for some reason many blind students believe
that they are studying effectively if they simply sit and listen</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to someone read a chapter. Unfortunately, this
method is almost useless. Statistics have shown that a person retains only
about 15 percent of what he or she simply hears when studying in this manner.
One does not remember much without writing it down. It is vitally important
that a blind student take careful notes from the material being read aloud. Use
a slate and stylus and sit at a desk or table when studying. Point out to your
reader the important passages that you wish to have underlined or highlighted;
then, after you have listened to your reader and have written down the
important points with a slate, ask him or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>her to record the important material he or she has
marked in the chapter. Listen to this condensed material and take notes while
listening to it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
would like to reiterate how important one's working environment is. I once
visited the apartment of a student who was not doing well in class but who was
using a reader consistently and studying at least two hours a day for a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>single course. This student was sitting on a couch
with her reader. She had no writing instruments within reach, and she was
listening to music on the radio at the same time. She heard the chapter read,
but she had no notes to refer to, so</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>she probably retained only 10 percent of what she
had almost heard through the music. In summary, it is wise to sit at a table or
desk, take notes, ask one's reader to underline important material, and tape
record this underlined material</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for future review. This method has proven to be
successful for many blind students.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
people make another tragic mistake in the classroom. These students decide to
tape record their class lectures, but they do not take notes while the tape
recorder is going. However, sighted students are taking notes with a pen or
pencil while listening to the lecture. By the close of the class, the sighted
students have heard the lecture and also have hard-copy print notes to review
further. In contrast a blind student who depends only on the tape recorder
retains hardly any of the lecture; he or she has no hard-copy notes; in fact,
the blind student has almost nothing until he or she returns home and begins to
study by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>listening to the entire lecture again and again. It
is extremely important that one take notes while listening to a lecture. Writing
helps the mind focus on what is being said instead of wandering. Additionally,
this is an excellent way to begin developing faster and more useful notetaking
speed.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
raises another problem. Many blind students lack confidence in taking notes, so
a sighted notetaker is often assigned to help. A sighted notetaker is at best
an unsatisfactory way to handle one's college studies. Such</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>notes may well not be dependable and are unlikely to
include all the things and only the things that the blind student would have
written down. Taking notes is a highly individualized exercise since everyone
comes to the lecture with his or her own approach to and previous knowledge of
the subject. Moreover, a blind student who uses a notetaker in class has
already planted in the professor's mind the concept that he or she cannot do
the work independently. Finally, the blind student has wasted valuable class
time by not focusing on the lecture as attentively as his or her note-taking
classmates do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
order to compete on an equal basis, blind students must use their readers
effectively and find ways to keep them working hard in a team effort.
Cultivating and keeping good readers is important during a college career. You
must establish good working habits with readers. Stressing how important your
studies are to you can be an effective way of getting a reader to go the extra
mile. &quot;I am taking sixteen hours this semester, and I really depend on my
readers to enable me to make good grades,&quot; is not a bad thing to say to a
reader from the outset of the working relationship.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
is also important for the reader to recognize that the blind student is in
charge of study time. The reader is an employee, and the blind student expects
him or her to be on time and to read and work steadily for one- to two-hour</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>periods. During my college career I found it
difficult to keep a reader on task for more than two hours. Even my best
readers grew weary of reading continually for that period, and some of them
were ready to call it a day after one hour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For that reason I scheduled my readers to come in
every two hours. Since I was a day person, I usually scheduled my classes as
early in the morning as possible and kept my afternoons free to use readers,
having them come in every</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>two hours. I saved my evenings for further review or
to listen to textbooks on tape or to socialize when time permitted. I would
suggest that students schedule readers during the hours of their peak
concentration.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
it is important that the blind employer not be afraid to phase out poor or
irresponsible readers as quickly as possible. During my undergraduate studies
alone, I ired well over twenty-five readers, but I used only about seven for
any length of time. I never allowed them to take control of my study time; I
made sure that I was prepared to begin work as soon as they arrived. Many
students make the mistake of waiting until the reader arrives to get out the
work for the day, and fifteen to twenty minutes of precious time is then wasted
preparing to study. It would be much more efficient to have the necessary
materials organized and ready to read as soon as the reader arrives. This</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>preparedness minimizes the temptation to converse
too much. I would begin to answer chatty comments in monosyllables and comport
myself in such a way that it was clear I wanted to study. A wise and
disciplined blind student will communicate the idea that general conversation
is appropriate only after</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>studying is finished. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
some circumstances it may be appropriate to give an occasional small gift to a
particularly good and dependable reader. This gesture may keep him or her
working hard. For example, in college I had a very good reader who was not paid
expeditiously after I had turned in her hours. She was growing impatient to be
paid by the Commission for the Blind, and I could sense her consternation. I
bought her a small gift and attached this note to it: &quot;I couldn't make the
grade without you.&quot; She was touched and kept reading diligently until she
was finally paid. Don't take a good reader for granted--cultivate and thank him
or her.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span
style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
another occasion this same reader grew weary of reading for me after three or
four weeks of concentrated work, probably because I did not relent in my desire
to do well with my studies. She said to me one day, &quot;Couldn't we</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>just talk some time? Wouldn't it be nice to have
some bread and cheese and wine and just talk instead of studying all the
time?&quot; So the next time we were scheduled to read, I put a bottle of wine,
two wine glasses, a small loaf of bread,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and some packaged cheese in my briefcase. When she
met me that evening in an empty classroom of the history building, I opened the
briefcase and took out the contents, and we had a wonderful conversation for
two hours. After that she felt relieved not to be under pressure all the time;
and she read sedulously and without complaint for the rest of the semester.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remember
that good readers are extremely important to a blind student's success, but
more important is the way readers are used. Other important aspects of a
successful college career are the kind of working relationship one establishes
and how effectively a blind student keeps a reader working. Most important,
remember to write information down. Listening alone is not a satisfactory
method.</p>

the Editor: Jim Marks has been an officer in the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Montana</st1:place></st1:State> affiliate of the National Federation
of the Blind since 1992 and has served as his chapter's secretary since 1995.
Since 1988 he has been the director of disability services for students at the
University of Montana-Missoula, and he served two terms as chairman of the
Special Interest Group on Blindness of the Association on Higher Education and
Disability (AHEAD). For a number of years he has been a columnist on disability
issues for mainstream publications. In short, Jim Marks knows the disability
scene in higher education. As we approach the tenth anniversary of the passage
of the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is interesting to consider what impact
the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City> has had
on students and the institutions that work with them and sometimes against them
in the educational process. This is what Jim has to say:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>During
the debate before the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the
National Federation of the Blind took a position that surprised many. The NFB
said it would oppose the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act if the
bill failed to include a clause which gave protected citizens the right to
refuse an accommodation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
first I wondered what the Federation was up to. Reject an accommodation? Why?
But now that the law is ten years older and I'm ten years wiser, the reason for
the NFB position stands immutably clear. If we didn't have the right to refuse
an accommodation, those with good and bad intentions would rob the blind of our
self-determination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
ought to know. I am the director of a disability service at a public
university. The things that take place in higher education exemplify why the
NFB was right on in protecting the fundamental human right of saying,
&quot;Thanks, but no thanks.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Today's
blind student faces a learning experience which differs significantly from that
of ten or more years ago. Now disability service offices carry out many of the
services formerly provided by commissions for the blind and vocational
rehabilitation agencies. Although many colleges have had such offices since the
mid-70's, many more have proliferated since the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City> took effect. We are an infant industry
that is growing by leaps and bounds.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1988 I served about 120 students with an annual budget of $13,000 per year, a
figure which included my half-time salary. Now my office serves over 600
students with a budget of $340,000 per year. Where it used to be just me
working part time, now there are ten staff, forty student workers, and some
eighty volunteers. And my school isn't alone in this kind of growth. According
to the American Council on Education the number of students with disabilities
in higher education has grown to about 9 percent of any student body. From my
observations of other offices it is common for about 2 to 6 percent of a
student body to enroll with the disability service office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Done
properly, a disability service stays out of the student's way. Done poorly, the
office either kills the student with kindness or with outrageous, power-robbing
controls. Believe you me, as a Federationist working deep in the trenches of
higher education, it pays for blind students to be wary of the people who hold
jobs like mine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
bulk of my colleagues don't know much about blindness. Most offices gear
themselves to serve students with other kinds of disabilities. Blind students
make up tiny portions of the students enrolled. Therefore blind students must
be prepared to educate their disability services coordinators about blindness.
There are no knights in shining armor. Blind students must look to themselves
as their best resource in dealing with college.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Over-accommodation
trips up more blind students than any other flaw in the disability services.
Simply put, over-accommodation means doing for the student what he or she is
perfectly capable of doing for him- or herself. For instance, some blind
students must unfortunately use human note takers in course lectures. For some
students with other kinds of disabilities note taking levels the playing field.
But blind students can and do take notes for themselves. The disability
service, out of ignorance, applies note takers as a one-size-fits-all solution
to a problem that doesn't need to exist for the blind. When the able student
accepts the over-accommodation, he or she pays a price. Career success depends
on one's ability to manage information. Employers say, &quot;Don't know how to
take notes for yourself? Sorry. We're looking for competent employees who can
contribute to our organization.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
example of over-accommodation involves the sandwiching of the disability
service between the student and the instructor. Blind students must connect
with their professors. If the disability service office intervenes in this
relationship, it is over-accommodating.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many know about the
letters of verification that disability service offices write for students and
faculty. The letters verify that the student has a disability and a right to
accommodation. Sometimes the disability service office gives the letters to the
student to give to instructors. Sometimes the office sends them directly to the
instructors. In most cases the letter of verification is an option, one that
blind students really don't need. The blind student should be able to
articulate a personal request for accommodation. But some schools compel
students to use these letters. Here's how it works. The disability service
office tells the faculty that they should demand a letter from the disability
services before any academic adjustments are granted. In this way, the rhetoric
goes, the institution is protected best. Control rests with the disability
service office, its importance skyrockets, and the empire expands. Meanwhile
the student holds on to the letter as though it is the only passport to access.
Schools have now created dependencies where none existed before. Thanks to the
&quot;Thank you, but no thank you&quot; clause, the cycle of custodialism may
be broken by the blind student with spunk.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
battle--one that surprises many--must be waged over readers. The <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City> requires
communication within a program to be just as effective for the blind as for
others. Oftentimes alternative formats such as Braille, tape cassettes, large
print, and computer texts are used to assure communication. But some schools go
so far as to say these alternatives are all that's required. Consequently they
restrict the use of readers by blind students.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;

Midwest university <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City>
dispute resolution officer recently contacted me for technical assistance
regarding a blind student's complaint against a restrictive policy on the use
of readers. The policy placed all the controls in the hands of the disability
service, not the blind student. The office recruited, hired, and monitored the
readers. The policy even required that reading occur on the campus. Incredibly,
the policy went so far as to prohibit the reader from reading anything twice.
Fail to comply, the policy stated, and the service will be terminated, leaving
only alternative formats as an option. The final kicker in this story was that
the money for the reader program came from the rehabilitation agency rather
than the university. It wasn't even their money; yet the controls choked
self-determination by the student.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Defining the Role of Disability Service Officers in Higher Education.&quot; The
workshop organizers wanted to deliver an unsuspecting audience of do-gooders
and control freaks a lesson in how to do it right. One presenter said something
that stuck with me. He said the best disability services assure a process by
which students achieve self-determination. This means the services are optional
and put the student in the position of control. Sound familiar? It should,
because self-determination rests at the core of Federation philosophy and
practice.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

personal responsibility shapes best practices in disability services in higher
education. We must remain vigilant about the seductions of over-accommodation
and the dangers of custodialism. Remember that saying &quot;Thanks, but no
thanks&quot; is healthy. I, for one, am glad the NFB had the imagination to see

The university's job is to educate. This means education, not only in specific
disciplines, but in one's general preparedness for living. If the university
misses this second mission, it fails the student even if it graduates a perfect
specimen in the chosen discipline.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>For blind and sighted students alike this means learning how to handle
the responsibilities of adulthood. Everyone at a university is taking on new
challenges, learning new directions. For the blind student this must
necessarily include learning how to handle blindness-specific issues. One of
these is learning how to handle the demands of acquiring information when most
information is presented in ink print.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

at the issue this way. The blind student who can rely on others to locate his
or her books, handouts, and tests in an alternative medium in college will get
a rude shock when offering his or her services to a potential employer. No
matter what the law seems to say, every employer has the right to watch its
bottom line and to hire the most efficient workers it can get. The blind
student who can rely on a college service to get a book cannot rely on an
employer to get a report in an alternative medium. What does the former blind
student and now the blind employee do when information is available only in
print and must be digested, analyzed, and used in his or her job by Monday? Can
the former blind student explain to the employer that someone else has to
arrange to transcribe or record it? No. At that rate the blind employee will
soon be a former employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the information for himself or herself. Disabled student service offices do
their best work for blind students when they give students the freedom and the
incentive to learn information-gathering for themselves before a paycheck is
riding on having the skill. Without the knowledge of how to gather and use
information under all circumstances, the blind person is likely to spend a lot
of years being a potential employee instead of an employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Why do blind students not know this? All of them came through high school as
blind students or have recently lost their sight. Neither group currently has
the skills. Those who grew up as blind students know only that someone else
always got their books for them. That's convenient; it worked in high school.

On a job the blind person must be able to compete. He or she must have the

brains and initiative and creativity; at least employers of college graduates
purport to do so. Colleges that provide all necessary information to blind

As I am sure is obvious by now, I think that disabled student service offices
have a role in assisting blind students very different from the role many play.
Their role should be to facilitate the blind student's learning how to do
things for himself or herself, not doing them for the blind student. This concept
is fully developed by Marci Page, an employee in a disabled student service
office. [See the January, 1993, issue of the Braille Monitor.] I have attached

I know that these are not the usual ways of looking at this problem. Service
providers faced with what appear to be crises or impending crises are oriented
to solve the immediate problem as fast as they can. Interpretations (what I
think are misinterpretations) of laws press in the same direction, all unwise. I
think it is time to add the dimension of time to this analysis, deliberately to
look beyond the immediate problem to the consequences of the apparent solution,
and to be guided by this longer measurement. Aristotle would agree.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

consequences of this immediate problem-solving orientation is that colleges
mentally classify the blind as subject to different rules. If you get your
books through the school and if the school has not gotten the books, then the
student cannot be held responsible for being behind in class. Nonsense. The
student is a student and is there to learn. While learning the subject, the
blind student is also learning how to learn, how to manage information. He or
she should be held to the same standard of promptitude and completeness as
other students and should be glad of it. Likewise, when a blind student can
blame others for not producing so-called necessary help, the message is sent to
the blind student's colleagues that the blind are subject to a different and
softer standard. Bad for employment in the future--college colleagues are
future employers; the blind student, too, comes to expect a softer standard and
cannot fend in the real world when it hits.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

sight. But its provisions are seen by all too many blind people as the
appropriate trade-off for sight. It's never said this way; it's only thought.
But the thought is poisonous to our independence. The thought is: Someone else
is responsible, must take the actions I as a blind person cannot, and is
available for blame when things don't go right.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

blind students in college today this poisonous thought has its roots in today's
misapplication of the full-inclusion approach to the education of blind
children--familiarly known as mainstreaming. While not opposing full inclusion
itself, I observe that its products--and most of the handful of students
educated by other systems as well--all too often arrive at the doors of
colleges, technical schools, or rehabilitation agencies without life-coping
skills. Someone else has always gotten books, arranged classes, overridden
inconvenient obstacles, and produced tests and handouts for them. In elementary
and middle school this makes sense. But high school students should be moving
toward handling these tasks for themselves to the same degree that their
sighted peers do and even more so. Blind people will always access information
differently, and we need to learn early and skillfully to acquire and process
it for ourselves. Today this move is uncommon.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Colleges using this approach in serving blind students are graduating men and

the diploma is awarded. Everyone, that is, except the blind person, who in a

what is missing is life-coping skills, and many blind graduates never quite

it. The answer, of course, is blindness training which includes life-coping
skills as a necessary part of the training. But the college graduate is often
reluctant to admit to himself or herself that there are still areas needing

this federal-state partnership program should provide. My point is that,
without DSS and with minimal services from V.R., we blind students back then
were forced to find methods for coping that began with reliance on ourselves.
We used the basic principle I tried to explain to the dean: educational
institutions are there to educate, and rehab is there to provide blindness-specific
tools and support. Mixing the two makes no sense. I hear people today say
things like &quot;My rehab counselor says I have to get all my services from

the job of rehabilitation, I don't know. But that's what is happening. Blind
students today are told that they should get computers and readers and books in
alternative media from their institutions, which in effect turns the college
into a rehab agency. As we all know, nature abhors a vacuum, and rehab has
certainly left a vast amount of vacuum to abhor in its alleged provision of
services to blind students. Think of it: Congress passes <st1:City w:st="on">ADA</st1:City>
as a civil rights law to end discrimination against the disabled, and the next
thing we know the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City>
has been transformed into a mandate that colleges must provide readers! In
reviewing this twisted logic, keep in mind that, if rehab had been doing its

providing sighted guides to take blind students to class or human note-takers
to fill the literacy gap.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

to the main point: the job of educational institutions is to educate. We as
blind students should interact with our colleges in the same way that other
students do--registering for classes by ourselves, working out details of
classroom performance ourselves, completing assignments or flunking for ourselves,
and solving the myriad of tasks all sighted students are expected to perform on
the way to graduation, just as they do. On the way we learn those same coping
skills that sighted students learn. Don't forget for a minute that sighted
students are doing the same thing. They fail to get instructions right, fail to
get to the library to get the reserved material assimilated, don't know where a
classroom is before they first go to look for it, take notes for themselves or
do not as they decide, learn to perform all the tasks or to take the
consequences. It's part of the educational process. Blind students should be

circumstances similar to those of people using wheelchairs. Blindness is the
only disability I know for which the real or perceived barriers are wholly in
the minds of blind people ourselves and the minds of the educators with whom we

many blind students glad for an extra hand, a ready-made way to get things done
that seems easier than doing it oneself. The thing such students forget is
that, when someone puts a floor beneath you, preventing you at all costs from
failure, that same person prevents you from succeeding. In order to have the

today's campuses, don't understand today's world as seen by them. They're going

when we discover self-reliance, when we build our own dignity, when we learn to
handle tasks for ourselves without even thinking much about it. In other words,
we win when we find out who we are and reject the trappings of custodialism,
however they are dressed up and disguised. In a very real, very practical sense
that is exactly what Dr. Jernigan meant when he said: &quot;We know who we are,
and we will never go back.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>A Teacher's Perspective</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>From the Editor: Sheila Koenig was a 1995 NFB Scholarship
winner. Now she is a middle-school English teacher with a deep commitment to
her calling. The following is the text of the speech she delivered to the 1999
meeting of the National Association of Blind Educators in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:City></st1:place>:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Many times during this past year we have heard the sounds of
gunfire and sobbing issuing from schools as people's lives are forever changed.
Though I am saddened and disturbed by the rise in school violence, I think that
as educators we must stay focused on the positive sounds. We are all here
because we value the profession of teaching, and there would be no profession
if it weren't for the kids. So we need to remember shouts of joy as a winning
point is scored, applause rising after a solo in a musical assembly, and
discussion building as students listen to and talk with one another. I want to
make a difference. I want students to explore the power of their imaginations
and discover the beauty of language. This is why I teach.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Those first days before students came to class were hectic.
As a new teacher I received mountains of new information and met dozens of
people. While trying to learn policies and names, I also worked feverishly on
organizing my classroom. Using a reader, I learned which lockers would be
assigned to my homeroom. I decided which posters to take from the walls and
which to leave hanging.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>I also adapted the TV so that I could adjust channels and
volume easily. Students in our middle school watch a ten-minute program daily
called &quot;Channel 1.&quot; It is a way of keeping students informed about
current issues. Since the buttons on the TV were separated by only a
fingernail's width, I used dymo tape as a labeling tool. I could easily feel
the first button on the right. That was the power. Then came channel up and
channel down. I placed a Braille &quot;c&quot; beneath the channel up. I used
the same procedure for volume up and volume down, placing a Braille
&quot;v&quot; beneath the volume up. This way, if the volume was too low, I
knew immediately that the button above the &quot;v&quot; would raise it.
Conversely, if the volume was too high, I knew that the button immediately to
the left of the &quot;v&quot; would lower it. By using a reader in this way, I
quickly completed these small tasks, which allowed me to focus more intently on
the larger ones.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Those larger tasks always come together on the first day of
school. Seating charts, attendance, learning names, presenting the syllabus,
and discussing blindness are the main items on my first-day agenda. The first
year I found that the way I had designed my seating chart automatically flowed
into a discussion of my blindness. In front of my room is a large table. Before
each class I place index cards on the table. On one side students find their
names in print and Braille. On the other are grid coordinates, such as A1, C5,
and E6. The letter represents the row in which the student is to sit, and the
number represents the seat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>In this way students walk into my classroom. I greet them at
the door, and they find their note cards then quickly their seats. After the
standard, &quot;Hi, I'm Ms. Koenig, and it's great to meet all of you.&quot; I
easily move into, &quot;You probably noticed that there are some raised bumps on
the note card you just picked up. Those bumps are your names written in
Braille, and I put them there to show you how I read.&quot; I proceed to talk
about other techniques they would see me using. I explain that I walk with a
cane, which serves as a tool to help me find objects that might be in my path.
The most important idea I want to convey in this first-day discussion about
blindness is that I am totally comfortable with my blindness. It is a
characteristic, like having brown hair or blue eyes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>To enforce this idea further, I ask them to ask me
questions. Most often someone wants to know how I get to school every morning.
I explain that I carpool with other teachers and pay them gas money. I could
also take a taxi or a bus. Sometimes students are not comfortable asking questions,
but I know their discomfort will disappear quickly. After I tell them about my
blindness, I tell them other characteristics about myself. I enjoy reading,
writing, exercising, shopping, going to movies, visiting with friends. . . .
This is my way of letting them know who I am, and we can establish a community
atmosphere from the beginning.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Remember the note cards the students picked up as they
entered my room? Braille note cards are an excellent way to take attendance.
Call out names and make two piles: those present and those absent. Attendance
can then be easily marked on an attendance chart. Hand-raising is something
most students are curious about. I tell them that since I can't see their hands
in the air, in this class they will say their names as they raise their hands.
Because this is a very different procedure, I give them a practice run by
saying, &quot;On the count of three we'll all raise our hands and say our
names. One, two, three.&quot; I say my name along with them. We all laugh at the
mumbled sound of so many names being spoken at once; then we move on.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Most of all I want my students to see me as any other
teacher. Last year I took my turn at after-school detention, breakfast duty,
and before-school supervision. Students who were in sixth grade would come up
to me and ask, &quot;What do you teach?&quot; So they get to know me as they
would any other teacher before even setting foot into my classroom. But I think
it's important to step beyond these required duties. As I climbed the bleachers
at a volleyball tournament, I heard shouts of &quot;Hi, Ms. Koenig!&quot; from
the team. As I smiled and waved back at them, I marveled at the energy my
arrival seemed to infuse in them. At school dances I sold refreshments and
monitored the floor. My students and I joked about couples needing to be a cane
length apart while dancing. I made it a priority to attend spelling bees and
music ceremonies as well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>In addition to students' seeing you as a vital part of the
school community, colleagues and administration must see you in the same way.
In January volunteers were needed to judge at a citywide speech and debate
tournament. I thought it sounded interesting and volunteered my time. The
typical process was that a contestant entered the room and wrote his or her
number and speech title on the board. I simply asked them to read aloud
anything they printed. In this way I received the same information as the other
judges in the room. I told my reader what to mark on the score cards, and I
returned the envelope to the counters. As the end of this year approached, an
advisor was needed for National Junior Honors Society. I volunteered instantly,
even though no stipend was given. I wanted to give something back to the school
that had just hired me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>One reason I chose to become active in the school community,
besides wanting to support the kids, was to demonstrate to my colleagues that I
stood on equal footing with them. On one of the first days of orientation, an
eighth-grade teacher said to me, &quot;So, do they have an aide for you?&quot;
A look of surprise and worry crossed her face when I said that no, I didn't
need an aide in my classroom. Sighted people rely so much on their vision that
they absolutely cannot comprehend how they would function without it. I believe
it is my job to educate these people, to show them how to be successful using
alternative techniques.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>I don't know what this teacher thought would happen in my
classroom, but by the end of the year I felt comfortable joking with her, and
she had become much friendlier toward me. Even people who had gradually come to
know me through the year at times had doubts. As our team planned the field
trip to the nature center, where we would walk some of the trails with the
students, I had the distinct feeling that the science teacher was worried about
me. She hadn't said anything, but discomfort emanated from her when we talked
about the trip. Finally one day she said to me, &quot;Sheila, you'd speak up if
there was a problem with the trip, right?&quot; I assured her that there was
nothing to worry about.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>There was a time in my life when I might have worried
continuously about this trip. But before I began my student teaching, I
attended BLIND, Inc., an NFB training center. At the center I traveled under
sleep shades in many unfamiliar areas. I knew that I had the skills to lead the
students successfully on these trails. I took the opportunity to walk the
trails with a friend before going with the students, and I would recommend
that, if you have the opportunity to check out something in advance, take
advantage of it. But most fundamental is having the skills to begin with.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>So my first year of teaching is over. I have learned much
more than I ever thought possible. I have certainly been touched over and over
by the simple joys of teaching, and I have been confronted with both positive
and negative attitudes toward blindness. One thing is particularly clear, and
it resounds over and over in my mind and heart. I could not have done it
without the National Federation of the Blind. If I had not met competent, confident
blind people, I would never have been able to see myself in that same way. If I
had not taken the time to learn Braille and cane travel, I would lack the
skills essential to being a successful teacher. If it weren't for the National
Federation of the Blind, I would not now be speaking to you about the wonderful
sounds of shouts of joy as a winning point is scored, applause rising after a
solo in a musical assembly, and discussion building as students listen to and
talk with one another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>sighted
teachers, and announced that I was an ISS substitute<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>teacher.
When asked what ISS meant, I told them it means, &quot;I SAID<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>SO!&quot;
From then on the students and I got along just fine.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Together we
made it through the class with each student making a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>contribution
to its smooth operation, accomplishing tasks and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>assignments,
and gaining a feeling of responsibility. The<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>students
felt a very important part of that class.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This entire teaching
experience was wonderful because, as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>the year
went on, I had the opportunity to meet and interact with<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>most of the
students in the school. At first I was a stranger,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>but that
feeling was soon gone. The more classes I taught<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>(including
auto mechanics; biology; sewing; and all kinds of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>history,
mathematics, and technical/vocational courses), the more<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>students I
became acquainted with. But more important, the more I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>taught, the
more the students got to know me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One sewing class was
particularly memorable. Not knowing<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>much about
sewing or sewing machines, I reversed the roles of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>student and
teacher. As it happened, I had two loose buttons on<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>my shirt,
and I asked a couple of the students if they would use<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>me as an
example and teach me how to sew these buttons back on<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>securely. I stripped
off my coat, tie, and shirt, and we fixed<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>those
buttons together. We all learned from this experience, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>they had the
opportunity to see me as just a regular person.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this one school
year of substitute teaching I discovered<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>that I
really do want to go back into the education profession. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>have applied
for a permanent teaching assignment for the next<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>school year,
but if none is available, I will substitute again in<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>the same
program. I remember one of my math teacher friends<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>saying,
&quot;We teach if the students let us teach.&quot; I was treated as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>a peer by
the faculty and staff, and I was treated with respect<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>by the
students. But to me the more important thing was gaining<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>recognition
from the students. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This past year I was
treated as an equal. Our school has an<o:p></o:p></span></p>

nationally recognized newspaper. Many times we as<o:p></o:p></span></p>

persons are excluded when printed information is<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>distributed
because people think that we cannot get it read or<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>that we are
not interested. They assume that, since we cannot<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>see, we
don't want the information, and they simply choose not to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>deal with

wonderful feeling I had the day I walked into the school,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>Climbing the Acropolis</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Susan Povinelli</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
the Editor: The following story first appeared in the Summer, 1996, issue of
the Vigilant, the publication of the NFB of Virginia. Susan Povinelli is an
engineer by training. She works for the United States Navy. She, her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>lawyer husband, and their children live in the <st1:State
w:st="on">Virginia</st1:State> suburbs of <st1:City w:st="on">Washington</st1:City>,
<st1:State w:st="on">D.C.</st1:State>, and are active in the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Virginia</st1:place></st1:State> affiliate. This is what Susan says:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
I climbed the multitude of steps to the top of the Acropolis in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Athens</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region></st1:place>,
I thought of all the ancient Greek philosophers who climbed this path to the
summit to sit and contemplate the meaning of life. I reflected on the wisdom of
those ancient philosophers. Now I reflect on how I took that opportunity to
travel to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
April, 1993, I was offered a job with my agency's training group as a training
system manager to support one of our foreign military sales programs. I
remember spending one sleepless night contemplating two great philosophical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ideas. The first was the general public's philosophy
of blindness: that because of helplessness a blind person cannot travel
independently and conduct business in a foreign country. The other was the
National Federation of the Blind's philosophy that a blind person with the
proper skills and training can travel independently and accomplish a multitude
of jobs. I recalled a blind colleague's struggle to enter the foreign service,
and I decided that, if he could travel abroad independently, so could I. So I
accepted the position. That sleepless night was not the last time these two
competing philosophies would come into conflict</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>around me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About
a month after I started the new job, a discreet effort was made to transfer me
out of it. The old philosophy of blindness had reared its head again. Questions
were raised. How would the customer perceive and react to a blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>manager? How would a blind person be able to
interpret nonverbal<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>communication?
I assured them, as I had done many times before, a blind person using good
management and blindness skills could do the job efficiently. As for nonverbal
communication, there would be others available to advise me on any matter I had
missed&#8212;nonverbal communication or technical issues.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let
me briefly describe what I do as a training system manager. When a customer
(foreign government) procures an aircraft, its personnel need to learn how to
maintain and fly that aircraft. The training team and I develop a training
program and then implement it. I incorporate the following techniques in my
job:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I use Braille
throughout my work. Pricing data are developed with a computer spreadsheet
program, which I then translate into Braille using the Duxbury translation
program on my MacIntosh computer. This allows me to reference the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>data while on the phone or in a meeting. I use
Braille briefing sheets that correspond to the printed view graphs. These are notes
for my brief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
job requires that I travel to the customer's country and assess the facilities
where the training will be conducted. This survey is usually conducted by a
team of technical experts. The experts and I look at the facility. The expert
points out what is wrong and what is right. We then discuss items needing
correction and develop a plan to remedy the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
of the management tools used is a milestone chart. This graphically displays
each event by its duration. For years I was baffled about how to make
raised-line drawings quickly and inexpensively. I learned to use a child's
screen board (a piece of cardboard with wire window screen placed over it). A
member of my support staff places the milestone chart on top of the screen board,
traces the milestone chart with a crayon, and labels the events in Braille.
This same technique could be used for floor plans, engineering drawings, or any
diagram which has few details. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now
that you know what I do and how I conduct my job, it is time to catch an
airplane and fly to <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Greece</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
I remember the first time I went. The rest of my team was already there, and I
had to make the trip alone. Once again the two philosophies clashed. Airline
personnel, especially in foreign lands, believe that a blind person cannot
travel independently and find the boarding gate. Most airlines have policies to
escort the blind person to an assist lounge or to chairs outside the boarding
gates. The questions that plagued me were, would accepting assistance impede my
independence? Would I miss my connection and spend the night in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">John</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">F.</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Kennedy</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Airport</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>?
Could I catch a taxi in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Athens</st1:place></st1:City></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>if no one met me at the airport? </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
realized that the real problem was not my blindness but my lack of Greek. I was
more frightened of not being able to communicate than of getting lost in an
airport. I frequently use the airport assistance services when I travel</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>alone because I know it is the most efficient way to
travel through large airports, especially in <st1:place w:st="on">Frankfurt</st1:place>,
where I know there are no chairs outside the boarding gates and the airport is
so large that dragging around carry-on luggage is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>difficult. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
can proudly claim that I have made that trip across the Atlantic several times
alone. As I was standing next to the rock from which <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Saint Paul</st1:place></st1:City> was supposed to have preached
Christianity to the ancient Greeks, I wondered what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>left in the

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That was in 1978 after
I had made the decision to leave the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>radio
station I had worked for as program director to pursue a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>career as a
rehabilitation counselor because at age twenty-three<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>I thought I could
change the world for blind people in my state.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>That, of
course, was not to be the case. The more disturbing<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>knowledge
that underlay my decision to leave radio was that I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>knew I could
not go from that radio station to a larger market<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>because I
was blind. So I used a career in rehabilitation as a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>cop-out. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span

working at my college radio station and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>moved on to
the local station in town when it decided to offer an<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>exchange. We
students would do radio shows at no charge for the<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>local station,
WEIC, which was in financial trouble, in exchange<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>for course
credit in communications from the university. The free<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>talent for
the station materialized; The course credit never did.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>So I suppose
you could say that I have worked for a sheltered<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>workshop for
DJ's. But I cannot stress enough how much fun I had<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>on the radio
while I was in college. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That kind of
high-level enjoyment is coming back now for me<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>as a
voice-over. A voice-over concentrates on reading script and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>commercial-narration
copy. A DJ plays recordings on turntables,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>tape
machines, and compact disk players in a radio station and<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>does some
announcing in between. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span

yelled [imitating the Wolf Man's voice]: &quot;Ah, bring<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>on the wolf

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now to get to reality.
Being in radio was a lot of fun. I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>met girls in
college who just liked hearing me on the air, so<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>we'd get
something going for a while, anyway. Lots of people<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>cheered for
us at public appearances, and the small town<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>newspapers
wrote about me as the &quot;wonderful blind radio<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>announcer.&quot;
That was before I joined the National Federation of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>the Blind
and came to know better. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now here is the money
part. In 1977, after five years of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>working at
that station, I worked as program director for $500 a<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>month. The
station owner bounced payroll checks, and we'd have to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>go to the
bar he frequented to get our money to pay rent. When I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>was working
as a rehabilitation counselor, I met a fellow named<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Pete with
whom I worked part-time doing radio shows. I was scared<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>station. But
two years ago I got up the nerve to call him, and he<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>set me up
with a contact he knew at a local TV station. That was<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>June of

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>1. Be confident in
yourself as a blind person. The person at<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>rehab and
wishing that I wasn't, there was a glimmer, a spark of<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>conviction
in all that sea of fear in me that the best place to<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>find out
what blind people can really do was the National<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>Federation

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt'>about real
belief in blind people--in other words, in myself--<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

Stark is an experienced social</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>worker. He was an alcoholism counselor for many
years and has</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>worked with troubled families and individuals in a variety

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>supervised human services students. In short, he
speaks from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>firsthand experience and full assurance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the 1994 national
Job Opportunities for the Blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>seminar, conducted at the annual convention of the
National</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Federation of the Blind on Friday, July 1, in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Detroit</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mr. Stark addressed the issue of working with
patients or clients</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>who are dangerous to themselves or others. Often
blind human</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>service professionals are discouraged or prevented
from such</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>activity on the grounds that they might be hurt.
Here is what Mr.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Stark had to say, based on his years of experience
with this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>population:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I owe a great debt of
gratitude to the Job Opportunities for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Blind Program. Three years ago I found myself
unemployed, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it was the JOB tapes I listened to that kept me
going and my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>self-esteem together. Despite my extensive
experience I found it</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>very difficult to find a job because as blind people
we have to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>deal with denial on the part of those doing the
hiring. Today I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hope to outline some things that can help blind
people in human</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>services to break through those barriers we all face
when the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>question of safety comes up. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'll begin by telling
you about one of the first patients I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>worked with way back in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Topeka</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Kansas</st1:State></st1:place>.
I was a recreational</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>therapist. One day, when it was pouring rain, I was
standing by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the door of the gym, and I made the simple comment
that it was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>raining cats and dogs. All of a sudden this woman
began seeing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>cats and dogs literally coming out of the sky. I
quickly said,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;I'm just pulling your leg.&quot; At the end of
that gym class she was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>waiting for me, and she was ready to pull my leg. I
was scared.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Thank goodness for a ping pong table that I went scurrying
under</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to get to the door. That was the point when I
realized that there</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had to be a better way to intervene in that kind of
situation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That experience put me on the track of learning how
to deal with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>patients who place me at risk.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I studied the
problem, I began to realize that I was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>really dealing with client safety. So remember, any
time you find</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>yourself in a job interview in which they begin
talking about</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>your safety, it helps to flip the issue over and
begin talking</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about client safety. One reason why these people are
under our</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>care is that they are dangerous to themselves or to
others. That</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>means there are three things we need to do: know our
clients;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>know our clients; know our clients. The more you
know about the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>client, the better off you are.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One time the nurses
called me in to work with a client who</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had already punched out three people. So I grabbed
the patient</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and said, &quot;Come on; let's take a walk.&quot; We
went over and stood</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>beside a wall. I knew the patient was right-handed,
and I wanted</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that hand against the wall. We talked for a while,
and I got him</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>settled down. But when we came back, the nurses
said, &quot;Frank, we</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>noticed that you were standing very close to that
patient while</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you were talking to him. Was that because of your visual</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>impairment?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I just laughed because
I had been keeping him close to that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wall so that, if he decided to take a swing at me,
he couldn't</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have gotten a full jab.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is just part of
learning to maximize the environment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>You have to keep track of where patients' hands,
feet, heads, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mouths are. Most of the time it is easy to tell
where their</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mouths are because they're usually yelling
obscenities at us. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I like to conduct
interviews at a table. And when I set up</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my office, I like to put the chair off to the side.
In escorting</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>patients, the best method for me is a modification
of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sighted-guide technique. When I take the patient's
arm, I extend</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my hand under the elbow and place my other hand over
the arm so</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that it can't fly up and hit me in the face. In this
way I can</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>escort the patient quite easily to wherever he or
she has to go.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Many times I can still let the patient act as
sighted guide. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's also important to
know what behaviors trigger clients.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For example, one of the hardest populations I ever
worked with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was drunk drivers. At one point I did a lot of
evaluations to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>determine whether or not they got to keep their
licenses.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Sometimes, when I would lift the license and
recommend treatment,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a livid monster would come out--over a driver's
license! I never</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>got that upset over not having one. But again, this
gave us a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>point from which to begin negotiations. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In working with
patients who are dangerous to themselves or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>others, we must establish and maintain our own
guidelines. For</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>example, I have made it quite clear that I never
chase patients.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>That's a security issue. If the client runs out the
door, I get</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>on the phone and call security or the police or do
whatever I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have to do to get that client back. I also like to
spend time</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>talking the patient down--defusing the situation. It
is very</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>important to defuse things before they escalate. If
you reach the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>point of physical intervention, the situation has
already gone</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>too far. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have also learned the
importance of simple common</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>courtesy. The Federation's philosophy of treating
people as</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>individuals is what agencies should be doing with
their own</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>clients. A lot of times courtesy will defuse
situations. Many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>times when I am called in to sort something out, I
find that the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>clients have not been treated as individuals. It
comes down to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>using plain old common sense. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You have to learn a
certain amount by trial and error.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Remember, anybody can get hit. We need to remind
people that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>there is no discrimination in a psychotic patient.
It doesn't</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>matter if you're blind or sighted. In fact, my
supervisor got her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ribs broken last year. Everybody is at risk working
with this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>population. Don't let people single out blindness as
the only</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>issue. The trick is to minimize risk: control the
interview area</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and establish good safety guidelines in treatment
areas. When I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was a recreational therapist, I learned very quickly
to keep the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>pool balls away from the gym socks. A pool ball in
the toe of a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>gym sock makes a great weapon; you can whirl it
around and bust</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>somebody open. Learn to assign equipment to
responsible people</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and not people who may be dangerous to themselves or
others. You</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can see that it just comes down to common sense. And
when you get</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>into a job interview, you have to communicate to the
interviewers</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that you have common sense to offer to that agency. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Remember that
generally we work as a team. So when a patient</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>goes off and is throwing things around, I let the
other members</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of the team handle that situation. But I'm right
behind them,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>handling the other clients in the room, making sure
that they</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>don't go off, because a lot of these behaviors
escalate. It makes</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sense for the people with the vision, who can duck
the flying</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>objects, to deal with that, while I am coping with
the rest of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the patients, getting the situation calmed down.
There's one</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>other advantage in working with a team. If I am
working with a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>client who is argumentative and wants to take me on
because he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thinks he can beat me up, he may well rethink that
idea when</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>there are two or three other staff around him as
well. It's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>harder to take on three than one, so there is
greater safety for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>everybody when you work with a team. So try selling
the team</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>concept when these questions of safety come up.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During the question
period that followed this address, Mr.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Stark offered to work with people individually to
demonstrate</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things like breaking a choke hold. A question was
then asked</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about working with psychotic patients in restraints
and in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>seclusion. Mr. Stark said:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When patients are in
seclusion, I begin by knowing the room</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>very well. I know exactly what is in that room. I do
not take my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>cane into a seclusion room. I don't want it grabbed
and used as a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>weapon. I leave the cane outside the room or at the
nurses'</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>station. After that it goes back to what I said
about talking</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things out with the patient. But remember that when
we talk about</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>psychotic people, we are really talking about
medication</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>problems. And that requires the intervention of
physicians. But</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>when I was working in drug abuse programs, I had to
deal with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>people on PCP. I had to be very careful about their</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hallucinations. In fact, I have one woman today who,
when she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sees me, sees the devil. She will be carrying on a
normal</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>conversation when suddenly she begins to groan and
her face</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>tightens up, and she sees a devil. When she sees
that, she wants</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to strike out, so she cleans off my desk. She just
takes her hand</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and sweeps off the desk. So I have come up with a
technique that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I'll share with you. It's a co-operative venture
between Circuit</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>City and me. I buy the little, cheap, forty-dollar
tape</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>recorders. When they hit the floor, I sack them up
and take them</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>back to the store. I have my tape recorders under
three-year</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>maintenance contracts at $3, and I'm on my fourth
one already.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It's a great deal! Then, when I get her calmed down,
we usually</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>take a walk. Walking is a great way of releasing
tension. </p>

membership in the National Federation of the Blind is that one's notions about
what is possible for blind people to accomplish are always expanding. I have
always felt insecure and vaguely apologetic about flower arranging. When I give
a dinner party, I mentally pull up my socks and tackle the cut flowers with the
desperate hope that I will not disgrace myself with the centerpiece. Without
considering the matter very deeply, I have always assumed that a blind person
could not be expected to do very well with creating a group of flowers in a
visually pleasing way. I humbly stand corrected. Moreover, I have just expanded
my garden for next season and have made a solemn vow to master the art of
flower arranging. The following article will explain my enthusiasm. Here is

non-traditional student at Ohio State Agricultural Technical Institute (ATI).
Diane is not only a student but also a wife and mother of four who is a
part-time employee. In addition to this, somehow she finds time to serve as the
President of Phi Theta Kappa (an honorary organization)and the FTD Club (a
student floral club).<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Diane is following a lifelong dream to be a floral designer.
She told me she has had a passion for flowers since she was a child. Like other
non-traditional students, Diane was concerned about how well she would do
returning to school as an adult. Would she be able to find her way around this
large college? Diane's determination to succeed in floral art was backed with
encouragement from friends and family. The only unique thing in this situation
is that Diane is legally blind with only a small amount of vision. Applying her
ingenuity, she is learning to design floral displays with non-visual
techniques.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Basically Diane designs fresh and silk arrangements by
seeing with her hands. If you watch her design, you can see her hands float in
and around the flowers, her fingers feeling the textures, shapes, and forms. It
is wonderful to watch her in the creative design process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>As summer begins, Diane is ending her first year at Ohio
State ATI. She recently completed the required ten-week internship at a local
flower shop, where she worked 400 hours (forty hours per week). To find a shop
that would accept her as an intern, Diane went to every flower shop in
town--not once, but twice, and sometimes more. She ran into so many
&quot;no's&quot; that she decided she would offer to work without pay for two
days before asking the flower shop to pass judgment on her ability. Her
perseverance paid off. One employer agreed to give her a chance. Diane was
hired as an intern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Working with Diane during her first and second quarter was a real pleasure.
Diane convinced me that she could do floral design within the first week. I had
no problem understanding Diane; what I had a problem with was the number of
people who told Diane and me that she had an unrealistic goal. I had seen what
she could do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Diane would use in place of the usual sighted techniques, I called Job
Opportunities for the Blind (JOB) at the National Federation of the Blind in
Baltimore, 800-638-7518. Several good ideas came out of that long-distance
brainstorming session with JOB director Lorraine Rovig.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>What Diane and I did was to start off with a Brailled color
wheel that we made together. She continually went over the color wheel to
memorize the primary and secondary colors. Next she listened to the lecture on
color which explained about complementary, split complementary, and analogous
colors. With this as the background, she added a mathematical system to put it
all together. Then she labeled her flower bins for the flowers sorted for her
by her sighted co-workers. With this method she knows exactly what effect she
is creating in her pieces. Some of these pieces were so large that the tallest
flowers or accent foliage were above her head when displayed on an appropriate
table or sideboard.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Diane said she continually goes over the color wheel to
ensure that she is error-free in her choices. Mixing colors together for the
arrangements is a real challenge since she has never seen color. A co-worker
takes a few minutes at the beginning of Diane's shift to tell her the colors of
the flowers; then she chooses the ones she wants to use.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:
"Times New Roman"'>Diane has discovered that she can move easily around the
flower shop and classroom. Dealing with her co-workers and the public is not a
problem either. Her caring personality, willingness to learn, and sense of
humor make everyone feel comfortable around her. Diane has found that her
employer and fellow employees can work together with her to develop a system in
the shop to deal with her disability. Her boss and co-workers have discovered
that the things they do to help her cost them very little in time or effort.
I'm delighted to report that Diane's employer was so impressed by her floral
designing that she offered her a job after Diane completed her internship.
After three quarters Diane is already a success in her field of study.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is the President of the National Federation of the Blind of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>. At the 1997 convention he was
elected to a seat on the NFB Board of Directors. This is what he said:</span></span><span
style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
am a senior attorney with Arizona Public Service Company (APS), a major
corporation in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>.
I am one of ten attorneys who serve as in-house counsel for the company. APS is
not a municipality or government agency; it is a publicly-held corporation and
the largest electric utility company in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>.
So what do I do as a senior attorney with a major corporation? I practice law,
of course. But if all you know about attorneys and the practice of law is what
you have learned watching Perry Mason reruns or the O.J. Simpson trials, you
won't know what I mean when I say, &quot;I practice law.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Just
as most physicians are not surgeons, most lawyers are not litigators. In fact,
it has been years since I have jumped to my feet in righteous indignation and
shouted, &quot;Objection, your Honor, that's hearsay.&quot; If most of us
lawyers are not litigators, then what do we do? As I said, we practice law. What
does it mean to practice law? We were told in law school that it means to think
like a lawyer. I recall the dean of the law school telling all of us first-year
law students that we would be required to take classes in many legal subjects
such as contracts, torts, civil procedure, criminal procedure, Constitutional
law, criminal law, evidence, tax, etc., and that we would, of course, be
required to learn the laws in each of these subjects and develop skills in
legal research, legal writing, oral advocacy, and other procedural aspects of
practicing law. But he said the fundamental purpose--the real purpose--of going
to law school was to teach us to think like lawyers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
incident that happened to me early in law school should illustrate the three
aspects of legal training: learning laws, developing skills, and, most
important, beginning to think like a lawyer. In the first year of law school,
we were required to take the criminal law class. The criminal law professor had
served for over twenty-five years as a renowned criminal prosecutor in southern
<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>.
In his class, when he called on you, you were required to stand and attempt to
answer his barrage of questions while he systematically pinned you to the wall.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
make things worse, the whole procedure was videotaped, and you were later
required to review the videotape with the professor. One of his purposes was
obviously to get us used to responding on our feet while under pressure--as I
am now. While reviewing the videotape, the professor would critique our
posture, gestures, and facial expressions, saying such things as &quot;Look,
you licked your lips. What did you do that for?&quot; &quot;What is your hand
doing in your pocket?&quot; &quot;Why are you grimacing? You look like a scared
rabbit.&quot; One day, in the first week or two of law school, the professor
asked a question based on a substantial reading assignment. He asked about the
six elements of the common definition of burglary, which is the breaking and
entering of the dwelling of another at night time with the intent to commit a
felony. He then asked for the common law definition of &quot;night time,&quot;
and no one he called on knew the answer. He glared at us and growled,&quot;
Didn't anyone read the footnotes?&quot; The answer was given in one little,
obscure footnote in one of the many cases that made up the previous night's
reading assignment. Fortunately, I had read the footnotes; unfortunately, I
raised my hand. I was so dumb I didn't know you didn't raise your hand in Mr.
Dean's criminal law class. With obvious pleasure the professor said, &quot;Mr.
Gardner, stand up.&quot; That's the way he sounded when he was about to eat a
first-year student. Well I stood up, and he said, &quot;What is the definition
of night time?&quot; I replied with the definition given in the footnote, &quot;The
time between sunset and sunrise when it is too dark to recognize a man's
face.&quot; The professor then moved in to pin me to the wall. He said,
&quot;Mr. Gardner, what if there is a full moon and it is a clear night so that
you can easily recognize a man's face a block away?&quot; Without really
thinking, I replied, &quot;Mr. Dean, I'm blind. It doesn't matter how bright
the moon is; I could never see a man a block away, never mind recognize
him.&quot; The whole class burst out laughing. The professor, with a chuckle in
his voice, said, &quot;Okay, Mr. Gardner, sit down. I can tell when I have been
beaten.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
the fact or maybe because of the fact that I had inadvertently won the first
round, I was given many opportunities along with my peers to engage in mental
jousting with my criminal law professor. Although no one has ever explained to
me what it means to think like a lawyer, I believe it means that, when faced
with a situation, and keeping in mind the laws he has learned, a lawyer should
look at the matter from all possible angles, creatively brainstorm and identify
all of the positives and negatives that could conceivably result from the
situation, then carefully analyze, critique, and evaluate each of the positives
and negatives identified, throwing out those without any merit. The remaining
pros and cons are then carefully reviewed and analyzed so that ways can be
found to minimize the minuses and capitalize on the pluses. Now I recognize
that this is probably an overly simplified explanation of what it is to think
like a lawyer. However, that is what I do daily for APS in a variety of areas.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
example, I handle the legal real estate matters for the utility company. Since
APS is the largest property tax payer in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Arizona</st1:place></st1:State>,
it is safe to say the company has its share of real estate issues. Nearly every
day I handle power line easement and right-of-way matters such as how and where
the utility company should build its power lines in light of concerns that
electromagnetic fields (<st1:place w:st="on">EMS</st1:place>), which emanate
from power lines, might cause adverse health effects.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Additionally,
I handle the legal aspects of buying and selling real property. For example,
when the company outgrew its corporate headquarters building and it was decided
that for political reasons it should lease rather than own new office space, I
negotiated all of the legal aspects of the construction and lease of our new
twenty-story corporate headquarters building. I drafted and negotiated the
multi-million-dollar contract for the sale of the old office building.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
real property issues are only a small part of what I handle for the company. I
also oversee all of the numerous tort and commercial litigation cases. It is my
job to select the litigators who will try the cases for the company, and I
oversee their actions to assure that sound legal analysis and advice are being
provided. This means that I must carefully analyze the strengths and weaknesses
of the company's position in each case as well as evaluate the legal skills of
the litigators I have retained. There are many millions of dollars at issue in
each of these cases.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
the coordinator of litigation cases, I also direct the legal investigation of
accidental electrocutions and other serious accidents which could result in
lawsuits being filed against the utility company. Additionally, I handle a
substantial number of miscellaneous matters, such as the legal aspects of
selling electricity in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
It has been my job to guide the company through the legal administrative and
bureaucratic mazes required to obtain the Presidential permits, licenses, and
other authorizations necessary to construct power lines across the
international border into <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>.
Many approvals are required from numerous federal, state, and local
governmental agencies in addition to the International Boundary Commission and
the Mexican government. As a result of these efforts, last year APS became the
first <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region> company
to sell electricity directly to a retail customer in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Mexico</st1:place></st1:country-region>. I both drafted and
negotiated that contract.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
is company policy at APS that no major decision is to be made without the
benefit of legal analysis and advice. Consequently, on a daily basis I receive
a variety of e-mail messages and telephone calls from numerous clients
throughout the company explaining their situations and asking for advice. I
outline their various options and explain the pros and cons and legal
ramifications of each.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
I feel rather uncomfortable speaking about myself, I have shared with you a
glimpse of what I do for a living, not to be boastful, but to make a point. The
fact is that my blindness is irrelevant to my clients. They come to me because
I look at their problems and opportunities from all angles and can spot issues
and can see solutions. They come to me because I think like a lawyer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>However,
and this is the point I wish to make, I simply would not be as successful if I
did not also think like a Federationist. In fact, I doubt that I would have
gone to law school if I had not first learned the truth about blindness and
begun overcoming the low self-esteem and low expectations I developed as a
blind child. Until I learned the truth about blindness from the National
Federation of the Blind, all I knew about blindness was what I had absorbed
from society. Unfortunately, society's notion of blindness is one of
helplessness and dependence. Blind people are generally thought of as not being
capable of doing much of anything. Therefore, although my parents were as
positive and optimistic as they could be under the circumstances, growing up I
had low self-esteem and low expectations.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
remember going to the eye doctor as a child and hearing him tell my parents
that, because my blindness was probably hereditary, they should make sure that
I never got married or had children. I recall my mother sobbing and feeling that
it was somehow her fault that I was blind. The clear message I absorbed from
the doctor was that blindness was a terrible tragedy and that it would be
better not to be born than to be born blind. The cartoon show Mr. Magoo helped
to create and expand the shame and low self-esteem I felt inside. I refused to
admit that I was blind because blindness meant helplessness. Blind people were
bumbling, fumbling, Mr. Magoos, or worse, helpless dependents who sold pencils
on the street corner. Blind people were inferior, dependent, and helpless folks
to be pitied and cared for. Therefore, I tried to deny my blindness because I
could see light and dark, general shapes, and movement with my peripheral
vision. But the feelings of inferiority and shame would not go away. And of
course I did not use any of the useful alternative techniques of blindness such
as Braille and cane travel. To do so would have been to admit that I was blind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
high school I signed up for AP English. I was in all respects qualified for the
advanced course; however, the teacher told me that I could not take the class
because I was blind. She told me that there would be too much reading and that
I wouldn't be able to keep up. She said that because of my blindness I should
take the minimum of English classes. Of course she knew nothing about talking
books and other alternative techniques used by the blind. This well-intentioned
but uninformed teacher was so convinced and my self-esteem and expectation were
so low that I followed her advice and took the bare minimum of English classes
in both high school and college.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was not until I was in law school that I realized what a mistake I had made in
listening to her. She didn't have any idea what too much reading was because
she had never been to law school and tried to keep up with the reading
requirements there. I realized that I should have at least minored in English
to help me in the practice of law. In fact, I still feel that I am playing
catch-up on the English classes I should have taken. For example, to this day I
have a propensity to inadvertently split my infinitives.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Fortunately,
in college the National Federation of the Blind found me, taught me the truth
about blindness, and helped me overcome my low self-esteem and low
expectations. The NFB helped me develop the confidence I needed to go to law
school. Thanks to Dr. Kenneth Jernigan and the National Federation of the
Blind, I have come to learn the truth about blindness, which is that the real
problem is not the lack of eyesight but rather the public's lack of insight
regarding blindness. In other words, it's not a physical disability but a
social handicap, society's attitude, that is the real problem.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It
was Henry Ford who said, &quot;If you think you can or you can't, you're
right.&quot; Given opportunity and training, a blind person can find
alternative techniques for doing just about anything he would have done with
eyesight and therefore be successful doing whatever he decides to do. For me
that means practicing law. I am paid to think like a lawyer, but regardless of
how we earn our daily bread, it pays to think like a Federationist. For this
reason I will do everything in my power to share Federation philosophy with
others so that they too can benefit from knowing <o:p></o:p></span></p>

a young woman, wearing a hair net, dashing around to deliver meal trays to sick
patients confined to bed, prodding them to eat their chicken soup and
lime-flavored Jell-O. When people ask me, &quot;What do you do all day?&quot;
frequently this is what they have envisioned. However, it is not 100 percent

work as a clinical dietitian at a 250-bed hospital in <st1:place w:st="on">South

cardiology, orthopedics, and neurology. So I spend my day working with patients
who have heart problems, those who have had surgery to repair broken bones or
replace a joint such as the knee or hip, and those who have had strokes. I also
cover a sub-acute or extended-care facility (ECF) affiliated with the hospital.
Patients go to the ECF when they have recovered enough to leave the acute-care
side of the hospital but need more time before they're ready to go home.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

I am responsible for sixty to seventy-five patients on any given day. Basically
what I do is gather information about my patients to identify those people who
are at nutrition risk. Then I assess the situation and implement strategies to
increase food intake or recommend an alternative route of feeding when
necessary. The most technical part of my job is calculating the appropriate
composition of solutions used to feed patients intravenously. The solutions are
approved by the physician and then prepared by the pharmacy. I am also
responsible for teaching my patients about their diet. Nutrition education is
tailored to meet each individual's needs. Heart-healthy eating and eating for
optimum management of diabetes are the two topics I cover the most.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
often ask me, &quot;What do you need to do to become a registered
dietitian?&quot; First let me clarify: there is a big difference between being
a nutritionist and being a registered dietitian. Anyone of you here today could
claim to be a nutritionist. Those people wearing white lab coats at the health
food store in your local mall may have been working selling shoes last week.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
order to be a registered dietitian, you must first have a bachelor of science
degree in nutrition. In college you will study anatomy, physiology,
biochemistry, food science, and nutrition science. Accounting, economics,
business management, and social science courses are also required. Then you
must obtain hands-on experience through a year-long internship program. Finally
you must pass a national registration examination and fulfill continuing
lifelong education requirements to maintain your credentials. Depending on what
you want to do as a dietitian, advanced education might be good. I decided to
obtain a master of science degree in nutrition because I plan to teach at the
university level one day. So you can see that it is more challenging than just
putting on a white lab coat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>While
I was in college, no one ever suggested that I couldn't be a dietitian because
of my blindness. The faculty was very supportive. I used alternative techniques
such as readers and lab assistants when needed. I had numerous externship
experiences while I was in college, so I was able to explore the profession a
bit before I graduated. When it came time to apply for my internship program, I
decided to set my sights high. I applied for several of the most prestigious
programs in the country. There is a limited number of internship programs, so
entrance is very competitive. I also decided to apply for some programs that
seemed a little more attainable, just in case.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
the application form I did not mention my blindness because I didn't really
think it mattered. I didn't want to be excluded from a program because of
misconceptions about blindness. Internship directors are looking for reasons to
exclude candidates. I didn't want my blindness to be the issue. I was ecstatic
to learn that I had been accepted at the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Massachusetts
 General</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType>, a
1,000-bed Harvard-affiliated teaching hospital in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Boston</st1:place></st1:City>. I did tell them about my blindness
after I accepted their offer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
arrived in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Boston</st1:place></st1:City>
a few weeks before the program began, to give me time to move in. I made an
appointment with the internship director to discuss the program with her in
more detail and to have a tour of the huge facility. I wanted to help her to
feel comfortable with my blindness. I remember the details of that afternoon as
if it were yesterday. I had my tour; then I was introduced to Helen, the head
of the department. Helen invited me into her office to have a little chat.
After I sat down, she said to me, &quot;<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Lynn</st1:place></st1:City>,
I want to be honest with you: I don't think a blind person can be a dietitian.
I think it would be easier for a deaf person or a person using a wheelchair to
be a dietitian than it's going to be for you.&quot; We spent an hour discussing
how I was going to accomplish specific tasks related to my job. &quot;How are
you going to use the meat slicer?&quot; &quot;How are you going to take apart
the food chopper so you can clean it?&quot; &quot;Can you turn the knob?&quot;
&quot;How will you know if the employees are stealing food or dealing drugs?&quot;
&quot;How will you know if a patient is awake when you go into the room?&quot;
I answered her endless string of questions to the best of my ability. After the
questions were finished, I explained to her that we were going to need to
figure out some things when we got to them. I didn't know exactly step-by-step
how I was going to clean the food-chopping machine, but I knew how to clean my
own food processor. So to me it was the same equipment, only ten times bigger.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
I was leaving the meeting, Helen left me with some friendly advice. &quot;You'd
better go home and pray.&quot; I remained composed until I returned to my
apartment, and then I did what most young adults would do: I called my mother
in tears. She was as shocked as I was. We were Federationists by this time in
my life, so we knew that discrimination could happen, but now it was happening
to me. I'm certain that they would have terminated me from the program if they
could have, but I think they were smart enough to know that I wouldn't have
left quietly.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
had two choices: I could agree that a blind person couldn't be a dietitian and
return home to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>;
or I could stand my ground, which is what I did. But I needed people to help to
keep me standing. I immediately contacted Job Opportunities for the Blind and
got in contact with a blind dietitian in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Iowa</st1:place></st1:State>.
We talked on the phone. I don't think she told me anything I didn't already
know, but she gave me the gift of reassurance that a blind person could do and
accomplish what I was setting out to accomplish myself.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
wasn't alone. Throughout that year I had the support of the <st1:State w:st="on">Massachusetts</st1:State>
affiliate and the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Cambridge</st1:place></st1:City>
chapter. At the end of the year, though, my confidence was lacking. My
supervisors had encouraged me to do my job in the same fashion as my sighted
counterparts. It was as if they wanted me to be that sighted person they
thought they had accepted into the program. I was uncomfortable trying many
alternative techniques for fear my performance might be judged harshly. I knew
at the end of that year that I was a good dietitian. I had the knowledge, and I
had experience, but I couldn't hope to be an excellent dietitian unless I
attained more confidence in myself as a blind person and better blindness
skills.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
attending one of the top internship programs in the country, which turned out
to be a living nightmare, it was time to attend one of the top adult
rehabilitation programs in the country, the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
for the Blind. (We all know where the other top programs are located.) This was
a dream come true. I was a different person when I left <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Ruston</st1:place></st1:City>. An amazing thing happened when I went
for my job interview at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Harbor</st1:PlaceType>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Hospital</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>. This was the
first real job interview I had as a professional. My blindness didn't seem to
matter to my future boss one bit. We talked about it. I remember her saying,
&quot;Obviously you know you can do this job, or you wouldn't be here.&quot; It
will be wonderful when every job interview is like that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
know that I would not have been able to become an employed registered dietitian
if it hadn't been for two things. For these blessings I am grateful--for my
parents who were Federationists long before we discovered the organization and
for the National Federation of the Blind. As an organization the Federation
paved my way by changing society's views of blindness, insuring security,
equality, and opportunity. As individuals many of you have personally changed
my life. You have been my friends and mentors. I am thankful. If it hadn't been
for you, I might have told Helen that she was right. Instead we did not give
her that satisfaction.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2><a name=ranger></a>How I Became a Park Ranger</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the Editor: Not
long ago I came upon a Talking</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Book titled A Superior Death. The author was Nevada
Barr.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The mystery was fun, and the author's ability to
evoke the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>scene and the various characters was certainly above</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>average. But the most memorable thing about the plot
was the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>casual appearance of Sandra, a blind secretary in
the Park</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Service office. She was efficient, funny, and
knowledgeable</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about people and the workings of the programs she
carried</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>out. The techniques she used were accurately
described, but</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>no particular fuss was made about her competence or
her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blindness. It struck me at the time that this author
had</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>observed a good blind secretary at some time and
brought her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to life in these pages. Then one day Lorraine Rovig,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Director of the Job Opportunities for the Blind
Program,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sent me a copy of a letter she had received from
Lynda</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Boose. Miss Rovig had learned of Mrs. Boose's work
as a park</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ranger and had asked her to write describing her duties
and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the ways she had found to carry them out.<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read the letter,
I realized that here must be the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>inspiration for the character in Nevada Barr's book.
I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>called Mrs. Boose and asked her if she had ever met
Ms.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Barr. She confirmed my guess. For two years Nevada
Barr had</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>worked on <st1:place w:st="on">Isle Royale</st1:place>,
where Mrs. Boose worked. They lived</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>at opposite ends of the island, but they talked
often on the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>radio and telephone. Mrs. Boose assured me that,
although</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Barr had drawn on her observations of Mrs. Boose for
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>character, there was very little resemblance between
herself</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and Sandra. Here then is a matter-of-fact
description of how</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>one blind park ranger does her job:<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before I started
working as a park ranger, I was a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>teacher of severely handicapped children in <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">California</st1:place></st1:State>. Then</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I met my future husband, and my life changed
drastically.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When I met my husband, he was working for <st1:place
w:st="on">Isle Royale</st1:place></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>National Park, which is located in the middle of <st1:place
w:st="on">Lake</st1:place></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Superior, seventy miles from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Houghton</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Michigan</st1:State></st1:place>.
The Town of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Houghton is headquarters for the park. Some park
employees</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>live in Houghton year-round, and others live in
Houghton six</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>months and are on the island for six months. For the
past</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ten years my husband and I were in the latter
category.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So how did I go from teacher
to park ranger? I was in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the right place at the right time. I did not work my
first</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>summer on the island, but the next summer I heard
that the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>park was looking for a part-time dispatcher. I felt
I could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>do the job and went and talked to the chief ranger.
We</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>discussed dispatcher duties and talked about how I
could do</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>them. The rest is history. I was hired part-time,
which was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>two days a week. The next year the permanent
dispatcher</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>left, and I got his job.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My duties were to
monitor and respond to park radio</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>traffic, monitor the marine radio and respond to any
calls</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to the park service from boaters, put up the flag,
take mail</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>out to the mail boat, which came about three times a
week.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This boat carried passengers around the island. I
also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>answered the phones and took messages. If there was
a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medical emergency, I assisted the park EMT's by
relaying</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>messages and calling doctors. This was the most
stressful</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>part of the job. I kept track of lost-and-found
items. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>also kept track of case incident numbers and issued
them to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the rangers when they needed them.<span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To do my job I had the
following equipment: a computer</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with voice output; a light sensor, which I used for
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>phones; a tape recorder; and a Braille writer. I
also had an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Optacon, which I used quite a bit to fill in forms
before I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had computerized templates.<span style='font-size:
10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the biggest
challenges was organizing the lost-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and-found. Each item had to be numbered, so I made a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>database on the computer, which included everything
that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>appeared on the actual lost form. People would call
me on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>park radio, I would give them a lost/found number,
and they</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would give me most of the information I needed for
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>computer. Then I would send them an envelope with
both</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Braille and print case numbers on it. I had them put
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>completed form into the envelope and attach it to
the item.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This way I could handle the lost-and-found items
without</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>much assistance from a sighted person. I made up a
phone-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>message form on the computer and filled it in whenever
I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>took a phone message for someone. I labeled all the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mailboxes in Braille so that I could put the
messages in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>right mail boxes.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My husband and I now
live in Houghton year round, and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>work in the Houghton Visitors' Center. Last summer
was my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>first summer in Houghton, and there were lots of new
things</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to learn: operating a cash register, taking Ranger
III</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reservations, and answering visitor questions and
requests.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The Ranger III is the park service boat, which takes</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>passengers to the island. The reservation program is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>computerized, so it didn't take too long to learn
how to use</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

Angela Howard is Second Vice President of the National Association of Blind
Students. This article first appeared in the Fall/Winter, 1999, issue of the

says:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>When Martin Luther
King, Jr., was growing up in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City>,
he rode the public bus across town to school every day. Segregation laws forced
him to take a seat in the back of the bus, even if the seats in the front were
vacant. Unable to do anything about the situation at the time, Dr. King decided
to leave his mind in the front seat and promised himself that one day he would
put his body where his mind sat. Years later Dr. King led African-Americans in
a movement to put an end to segregation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The blind do not
endure the segregation laws that once confined African-Americans to the back of
the bus. But, due to negative attitudes about blindness, we continue to endure
a kind of spirit-squelching segregation that has threatened to confine us to a
world of high unemployment and social isolation. Members of the National
Federation of the Blind have developed a philosophy that has directed us to
move towards a life of complete integration and full participation in society.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Our movement for
equality demanded at one time that we march and campaign in order to be heard,
and this is still sometimes necessary. But more often today our struggle takes
place in the work and play of our everyday lives. As Federationists we struggle
to put our bodies where the Federation has led our minds and spirits. We
struggle for the opportunity to participate fully in our homes, schools, and
communities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Recently my
Federationism led me to a very special place. I spent the summer living with
the homeless of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City>.
The Open Door is a community of religious leaders and former homeless people
who live together in service to those who are on the streets. I took part in
this community as a resident intern. In the Federation we like to say that
blind people possess the same range of personalities that any cross section of
society would produce. I have become convinced that this holds true for every
other group in society as well. I faced the same struggles against negative
attitudes living with homeless people that I do in any new community of which I
become a part. Most assumed that I would hold a marginal position in the
community, and in the beginning no one expected from me what I was capable of
contributing. It was up to me to break down those walls that threatened to
steal my right to full participation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My struggle against
negative attitudes began the first night I moved into the house. The woman
assigned to be my spiritual advisor reviewed with me the general rules of the
house. She then suggested, &quot;We thought you would be good at handing out
hard-boiled eggs to the homeless people at breakfast.&quot; When I learned what
my schedule was to be for the following week, it became clear to me that
passing out eggs during breakfast was the only job they thought I could handle.
After three days of handing out eggs from 6:00 to 9:00 a.m. and having nothing
else to do for the rest of the day, I decided that things were going to have to
change.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I began to voice my
belief that I could do much more than hand out eggs. I also developed another
strategy for solving this dilemma. I was beginning to get to know many of the
people living in the house and could sense which ones had the most faith in my
ability. When I noticed that one of these people was doing a certain job, I would
sneak over and ask him or her to show me exactly how the task was performed. I
even got people to let me try. Then during breakfast and lunch circles, when
certain jobs were delegated, I would raise my hand.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Are you sure
you can do that, Angela?&quot; they would ask.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;I've done it
before,&quot; I would say. My strategy worked. I found my schedule for the
following week much more promising.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Phone and door duty
is one job frequently delegated to resident interns. The responsibilities of
this assignment include answering phones, answering the door, and supervising
our homeless friends as they pick out T-shirts and socks from the sorting room.
As you can guess, the leaders of the community did not consider the possibility
that a blind person might be capable of meeting this challenge.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By the end of my
first week they decided that I might be able to answer the phones. I assured
them that I could write out the important phone numbers in Braille and deliver
messages personally rather than writing them out. They agreed to let me give it
a try.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>By the end of my
second week they trusted me to answer the phones, but fulfilling the other
responsibilities of phone and door duty was out of the question. Another helper
was always assigned to answer the door for me. I am not proud to admit this,
but even I was not sure that I could handle the responsibility of managing a
room of people who are often under the influence of drugs and who are known to
try to get out of the house with as many things as they can. Pretty soon,
however, all of us in the house learned a valuable lesson about blindness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Phone and door duty
is often a demanding job. I found myself quite naturally falling into the role
of assisting the person in charge of managing the folks coming in and out. This
gave me the opportunity to develop some alternative techniques for getting the
job done. For example, I learned very early on, because it was not possible for
me to describe someone visually, I needed to have another method of identifying
the people I was letting in. When a homeless person would come to the door and
ask to be let in to grab a T-shirt, I would ask for his or her name. This
practice also helped me to develop good relationships with the regulars who
came through our doors. I found that people appreciate being called by name
rather than being directed by a finger. Developing relationships of mutual
respect with many of the regulars put both them and me at ease. Soon
supervising the sorting room no longer seemed like an impossible feat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My biggest challenge was
figuring out how to keep people from taking more items than they were
permitted. When people are struggling to meet their most basic needs, they are
often forced to try to survive by manipulating others. Some of our homeless
friends have been known to get out of the door with eight pairs of socks
instead of one. I found that, since I couldn't monitor with my eyes how many
pairs of socks someone was taking, it was easier for me to hand them the socks
myself. I also learned to listen for clues that would tell me if someone were
trying to get out with an extra shirt or two such as a bag rustling too long or
too many coat hangers being moved.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I do not think these
alternative techniques were entirely theft-proof. I am sure that some of our
homeless friends sneaked out with an extra shirt or two. But it is an
understood rule at the Open Door that our friends will leave the house with
extra things. The key is not to let it be excessive. My alternative techniques
worked, and after a few weeks I was entrusted with all of the responsibilities
of phone-and-door duty.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Phone-and-door duty
was the most unpopular job among the resident interns. I hated doing it as much
as anyone else. But being expected to do the job gave me a sense of
satisfaction that ran much deeper than my hatred of performing the task. Being
assigned to phone and door duty meant that I was needed. It meant that
expectations of me were as high as they were for any other resident intern.
And, perhaps most important, it meant that I got the chance to complain about
how grueling the job was right along with my peers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Creating allies in
our friends and associates is an essential component of achieving full
participation. Befriending the other residents of the Open Door, as well as
many of the homeless people we served, helped me in my struggle for equality.
Many volunteers stopped by the Open Door at random to help us out. Coping with
the negative attitudes of new people day in and day out was a difficult
challenge for me last summer. My roommates and I used to joke that we had to
hear the amazing-blind-person speech every time someone new walked through the
door. On several occasions a new volunteer assumed that I was one of the people
she was supposed to help. I found, however, that as those living in the house
began to understand my struggle, they participated in helping me to educate the
new folks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every morning, after
we served breakfast to the homeless, we would sit down with our own breakfast
and reflect together on how the morning had gone. We learned many lessons about
blindness during these reflection times. One morning I had been assigned to
hand out tickets in the yard to those who wanted to come in for breakfast. A
volunteer, who had just arrived the night before, shared in her reflection time
that she was amazed that I could go out into the yard and hand out tickets.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She said, &quot;I am
afraid to go out there, and I can see.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We in the Federation
know that the even-I compliment is no compliment at all, and I was preparing to
give a little speech on the subject. Much to my surprise and delight, however,
my housemates in the group picked up on the fallacy of her logic and called her
on it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One man said,
&quot;It ain't got nothin' to do with sight. You're just scared of homeless
people, and we've gotta help you with that.&quot; At that moment I felt like
the teacher whose student had won the National Spelling Bee. Not only did my
friends inside the house help me to educate people about blindness, but I found
that my homeless friends also helped me to educate others in the neighborhood.
I had one friend on the street who was particularly special to me. His street
name is Bear. Bear is a crack addict and the most widely respected and feared
person in the community. As one man put it, &quot;Every homeless person and
policeman in the city of <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City>
knows Bear.&quot; Bear has a gift for being brutally honest and is a champion
for justice in his own way. Once a man who had a reputation for paying homeless
workers illegal wages came into the yard and asked who wanted a job. Many of
the men began begging him to let them work, and it was Bear who said,
&quot;Don't let that man take your dignity.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>It came as no
surprise to me that Bear would help me in my struggle for equality. Bear became
my good friend and helped me to educate others. When someone would make a
nuisance of himself by trying to help me too much, I would politely try to
manage the situation. But Bear did not believe in sugarcoating words. He would
say in his gruff voice, &quot;Shut up, she don't need no help.&quot; Bear
disappeared for several weeks in July, and when I saw him again, he was excited
to inform me that he had seen people from our National Convention downtown. I
had told them all about the National Federation of the Blind and about our
convention. &quot;I saw all them people you were talking about downtown last
week,&quot; he told me with glee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On the afternoon
of Friday, July 4, 1997, a group of Federationists told convention delegates
about their jobs and the ways in which their Federation philosophy has
influenced their work. Following are the remarks of four of them. The first is
Carla McQuillan, President of the NFB of <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>.
this is what she said:</span></span><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
am the owner and director of a Montessori school. We currently serve seventy
students ranging in age from two-and-half to eight years. We offer a preschool
program, an early elementary program, and child care for those working parents
who have children enrolled in our school. Our facility is 3,752 square feet. We
have three classrooms. It sits on about an acre of land. I supervise nine staff
members, three of whom are here at convention this year. I have Mary and
Margaret, who are working in NFB Camp, and we also have Gary Jeffries, who is
the blind cook at my school, serving lunches and snacks to our children every
single day. I think, if you asked the children, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Gary</st1:place></st1:City> is the most popular staff member we have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
responsibilities of a director are many and varied. It's kind of like a compact
disk player that's been set on a random song-selection. You never really know
what tune is going to pop up next. So sometimes I'm a janitor; sometimes I'm a
cook or an accountant, a nurse, a stern principal, a receptionist, a
supervisor, a cop (that's my personal favorite), a therapist, a friend, and
always a juggler. There are a lot of exciting events that happen around our
school. In fact, one of the most recent happened just on Monday. I got an
emergency phone call from the school. It seems that one of the popcorn poppers
set off the fire alarm; and, while all of the fire engines were screeching into
the parking lot, none of the staff there had the code to turn off and reset the
alarm. They are laughing about it now, I hope.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of my responsibilities are just short of heart-wrenching. As a child care
professional I am required to report any suspected child abuse. This last year
a five-year-old boy came to me and disclosed that his father was sexually
abusing him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have some unnerving responsibilities. I fired a teacher in March for throwing a
pair of adult scissors across the room with a group of children assembled and
then had the honor of replacing her in the classroom for the last three months
of the year, just in time for NFB Camp registration to start up.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I'd
like to tell you a little bit about how I got to where I am today in my
business. Some of you may ask why I chose to get to where I am. When I was a
young teenager and knew nothing about the Federation, I believed that working
with young children was something that a blind person could do. When I was a
senior in high school, I acquired a job as a preschool teacher at June Bug
Preschool and was pretty much a glorified baby sitter. There wasn't a lot of
teaching going on. My freshman year in college I taught music in a Montessori
school and was just amazed at the difference in the behavior of the children.
The Montessori children were attentive. They were well-mannered. They were well
behaved, and they were extremely bright, curious, and inquisitive. I enrolled
in a Montessori teacher-training program figuring I didn't know what it was
those teachers were using, but whatever it was, I wanted to have some of it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Montessori
for those of you who don't know is a very self-paced, individualized type of
instruction, and it's the use of the Montessori materials as they are
manipulated that helps to teach the child different concepts. In fact,
Montessori said that the more senses you incorporate into any learning
experience, the higher the retention level and the more effective the learning.
This also makes this method of education much more accessible for blind
children, which I'll talk about later. The overall philosophy of the Montessori
method is that of teaching personal responsibility, respect, independence--all
of which develops self confidence in the children. Montessori children, by and
large, are self-starters. They have a natural thirst for knowledge and
information, which is of course extremely delightful for the teachers who work
with them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In
1988 I was the recipient of a National Federation of the Blind of Illinois
scholarship, and at that point I came to learn some very strange and wonderful
things about myself, my peers, and my philosophy on human development. As I
came to work more and more with the Federation, I came to believe in myself and
to believe that I didn't need to work for somebody else, but maybe it would be
okay for me to work for myself and that I could be successful in the endeavor.
So I ran a home-based Montessori program for three years until my son was old
enough to participate, and then he decided that I was Mom and not a teacher,
and he wasn't having any part of it. So the next step was to go in search of a
facility for us to start our own school. In that pursuit we found a building
for lease with a capacity of forty-five students. I applied for an Oregon
Economic Development Loan that was designed specifically for disabled people
wishing to start their own businesses. And guess what? <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State> didn't think that I could make this
business fly. <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Oregon</st1:place></st1:State>
denied the loan, but I found out that the National Federation of the Blind did
believe that I could be successful, and I secured a small business loan from
this organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
it's the skills that I have learned through the work of the Federation that
have really gone far beyond the seed money in the way of helping me to become
successful. Children's <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Choice</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Montessori</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">School</st1:PlaceType></st1:place>
is unique in its philosophy even from other Montessori schools: philosophy that
is developed by and large through participation on my part with this
organization. When I take prospective parents through the school to decide
whether or not our facility is appropriate for their children, of course I go
around and show them the classroom and make sure that they understand that it's
a safe and comfortable and warm and loving environment. But I also emphasize to
the parents two goals that we have at our school for each of those children.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1)
The children will learn to work and play well with others. Even if they don't
want to go out and play on the playground with all of their classmates, we
require that they be respectful and coexist peacefully while they are in the
classroom. How many times have we seen Dr. Jernigan, Mr. Maurer, and other
leaders of this organization faced with the task of dealing with individuals
who are perhaps not our favorite people, who don't see things exactly the way
we do? In fact, at one point Diane McGeorge said to me, after having spoken to
a state agency director, &quot;You get done talking to him, and you just feel
like you want to take a shower.&quot; But throughout the course of her
conversation, not an inkling of that sentiment came through. She was respectful.
She was courteous, and that's exactly what we are trying to teach the children
at our school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2)
We teach the children to be responsible for their actions. This entails
recognizing that there are consequences for their actions and for their
inactions. We also believe that this perspective will ensure that the children
will never grow to believe that they are victims of their circumstances. Dr.
Jernigan was talking the other night to this scholarship class and saying how
we are in a society and a generation (both sighted and blind) who are looking
for someone else to blame for the position they are in today. We need to resist
that temptation. It is my firm belief that this philosophy needs to be
instilled at a very early age and brought all the way through life, and that's
exactly what we are trying to do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
Children's Choice we are teaching life skills. This is not something that most
of the other programs are doing. They are looking to resolve today's problems
without any look towards where those children will be in the future. I believe
our decision has contributed greatly to the success of the school.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>One
of the other things I have learned that has been invaluable to me is that there
are insufficient hours in the day to do everything that we would like to do. I
do not waste a lot of time and energy on those things that I cannot affect. I
try to spend my time resolving and solving all the problems I can do something
about. This is particularly helpful when I take on added responsibilities such
as NFB Camp, which by the way I love doing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Last
year I applied for and received a Small Business Administration loan so that we
could purchase the land and construct the building in which we now operate our
school. There was a bit of discussion between the builders and me about the
Americans with Disabilities Act, particularly with regard to the size of the
handicapped-accessible bathrooms. Using the skills that I have learned through
the Federation, I researched the regulations, and I challenged the builders at
their interpretation of those regulations. After I threatened to fire them,
they finally agreed to reduce the size of each handicapped bathroom by eighteen
square feet, freeing up enough classroom space to add two students more than
their plan allowed, and now I understand that they're circulating our
blueprints to other people who are thinking of building schools as a model
school environment. By the way, the obligatory handicap-accessible bathroom
sign that needed Braille--we have that. I have the technology to produce that
myself without any additional cost, and the Braille on that sign reads,
&quot;Deposits only, no withdrawals.&quot; The city inspector came by, ran his
fingers over that Braille, and we all sat and smiled.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>But
I believe probably the most exciting part of what we are doing at the school
happens when the Federation work and the Children's Choice work merge to form a
more perfect union. This summer the Oregon Commission for the Blind has placed
a high school student, through its summer work-experience program, to be
employed at Children's Choice Montessori. Clarissa is learning a lot about how
to work with children when you are a blind person, and she is learning a lot
about the National Federation of the Blind. In the fall we will have a
three-year-old blind child starting in Mary's classroom. Instead of being
threatened and upset, Mary is delighted because she has worked at NFB Camp for
the last two years. I am also told that there is a nine-month-old blind child
in the community whose mother has already told case workers that her son will
be at our school when he comes of age.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Every
day the compact disk sets on random song-selection; and we walk in, prepared
for the dance; and through the waltzes and the jigs and the dirges and the
ballads, occasionally we are uplifted by &quot;Glory, Glory, Federation.&quot;
Thank you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Public Radio and Public Television.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Let
me make it very clear to you that I am not a scientist myself, so it's a real
challenge to interact every day with a truly outstanding staff. That's half the
fun of being there. Our average professional staffer is a Ph.D. scientist or
engineer with numerous years of research and teaching experience acquired
before coming to the NSF. We have hardly any professional entry-level
positions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Here's
where I fit in. In recent years Congress has tried to focus accountability by identifying
particular individuals in the government who are responsible for performing
particular critical tasks (at least what Congress believes to be critical
tasks) so that one person will be answerable as to whether it's done right or
not done right. For instance, every agency has an inspector general to ferret
out fraud, waste, and abuse. Each agency is required to have a chief financial
officer. And each federal agency, including NSF, is required to have someone
called in the statute &quot;a designated agency ethics official,&quot;
responsible only to the agency head, whose job is to direct that agency's
employee ethics and conflict-of-interest-prevention efforts. That's my job at
NSF.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>NSF
spends about three billion of your tax dollars every year--that's billion with
a &quot;b.&quot; Almost all of it is spent on peer-reviewed research and
education grants and cooperative agreements. But even with as much as three
billion to spend every year, the problem is that lots more folks want money
from NSF than can get it, so the competition is fierce. It's not really a
question so much of weeding out unworthy science from worthy research; the real
issue is picking out the best science we can buy from the merely good. To the
extent that we can do this well, we earn the confidence of the scientific
community--the community we serve on a daily basis, as well as the general
public and the Congress. I think we can say that we have done this over the
years because at the bottom line Congress has supported NSF very well where it
counts, in the appropriations process.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>My
mission is to protect NSF to see that its procedures guarantee integrity and
fairness in the review process, that people don't participate in the
decision-making process when they have improper, even inappropriate, relationships,
affiliations, or financial interests that could be affected by what we're
trying to do with that particular program. Yes, at NSF we have to adhere to a
whole bunch of federal ethics regulations, but we have to do so in an
environment which is different from that in the typical federal agency or
office.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
instance, we are managed by a twenty-four-member, part-time,
Presidentially-appointed National Science Board that is deliberately set up to
come from and represent the science community we fund. We have to watch out and
make sure that we avoid conflicts of interest with their particular home
institutions. Unlike full-time agencies' board members like the Federal
Communications Commission, or something like that, these people are
specifically not asked to give up their outside interests or affiliations to
assume their part-time duty. We want them to be true representatives of the
outside. They are mostly college presidents, deans, and corporate R&amp;D
people. Another thing that is different about us is that at any given time our
professional staff is composed of 30 percent people visiting NSF as rotators
for only a year or two. We have to make sure that these people don't put their
thumbs on the scales to help their universities back home get some unfair advantage.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Another
distinguishing feature is that we use 6,000 panel peer-reviewers a year to
evaluate grant research proposals. Those folks, too, have to be
conflict-screened to make sure that they're going to judge on the basis of
scientific merit and not on the basis of their old buddies or where they have a
buck or two invested.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Now,
with all that said, in 1991 the National Science Foundation decided that it
needed to conduct a nationwide search for a new ethics official. I ended up
getting that job. It was truly an unusual application and interview process
that even involved my teaching a sample seminar and interviewing all manner of
people. My friends joked that, if I interviewed one more person to get this
job, it would be the Vice President. Anyway, I got it, and there were a bunch
of other people who wanted it, so I was happy to get it--a little bit surprised
because I had some ethics role in the Department of Labor, where I had been for
twenty years, but most of my job with Labor actually involved the Department's
legislative activities on the Hill. As it turned out, I guess they thought I
had a pretty decent background. In addition to my twenty years with Labor, I do
hold my undergraduate degree from Harvard, and my law degree is from
Northwestern.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>So
what I do in the ethics business--I'm a counselor--I advise people how to get
through the complicated ethics laws. I'm often a judge saying, &quot;You may do
this, and you may not do that.&quot; I issue hundreds of written opinions a
year. I'm part of the management team. Some of these big projects that we fund
(we had a 350-million-dollar one that I was involved in and got a big cash
award for how I handled it this year) have so many universities involved that
I'm basically working on the project right alongside the scientists every day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
deal with the White House on our Presidential appointees and nominees and often
am the first to know who is going to be on the National Science Board or who is
going to be Director or Deputy Director. I'm also our liaison person with the
U.S. Office of Government and Ethics. I have a great deal of sympathy for those
in the private sector because I too am in a regulated industry, and they come
and audit us and make sure that we're in compliance with all the governmental
and ethics enactments.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
don't do this work alone. I have four other folks in the general counsel's
office who spend at least some of their time assisting me. I spend a lot of
time keeping our various division directors and deputy division directors
up-to-speed and up to the latest on both our own procedures and NSF procedures.
Many of those procedures and regulations I wrote myself. I published two sets
of NSF-specific ethics regulations in the Federal Register last year.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
ask me what alternative techniques I use--not many really, I guess. I do have a
CCTV in the office, and I use screen enlargement software on my computer, and I
use Braille a lot. That's important. I obviously have residual vision, but one
of my critical jobs is that I must train about 700 of our staff in two-hour
training sessions every year. I do it in small seminar groups of about
thirty-five apiece, scheduled about twice a month. I just couldn't do two-hour
training sessions with case studies without my training outlines and all my
other training materials available in Braille.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>People
also ask me, &quot;Was blindness an issue in getting this job?&quot; The answer
is, &quot;Yes, it was.&quot; The people who interviewed me probably violated
all kinds of EEOC rules (and I'm glad they did) by asking me, &quot;How are you
going to handle computers around NSF?&quot; I knew the answers because I had
checked it out. I had been down to the exhibit hall. I knew about that kind of
stuff and how much it cost. What I didn't tell them was that I had no idea how
to use a computer in the first place. I figured, what the heck; if I got the
job, these are just machines anyway, and I know how to use machines. I learned
some about computers, as much as I needed to learn.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
only other issue about blindness was that early on there was some chatter about
how could they give this much unreviewable responsibility to a blind person?
That came back to me through third parties. Thankfully, and I hope through my
good efforts, we no longer hear that kind of stuff around NSF. I'm proud of the
job I do; I'm proud that it helps keep our science the best in the world. I'm
especially blessed to have the opportunity to come here to talk to you for a
few minutes about what I do because <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the Editor:
Maureen Pranghofer is a frequent</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>contributor to these pages. The following article
first</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>appeared in JOB Recorded Bulletin 167, January,
1996. Here it</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last November, after
considerable assistance from the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>staff at BLIND, Inc., and Minnesota State Services
for the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Blind, I began a small business. This past year has
been a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wonderful learning process. Hopefully, if you have
the yen to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>be an entrepreneur, you can glean something from
what I have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>learned.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>1. Know what your abilities are. After my accident</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in June of 1993, when
I became totally blind, I began</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>thinking about what
kind of career I might like to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>pursue. Working from
my home seemed to be the most</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>practical thing to do.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Make a list of things which you are good at and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>think about how they
could be used in a business. As you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>gain skills in
additional areas, they can be added to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>this list of possible
entrepreneur ideas. But it's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>difficult to start a
business unless you know well the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>area which you are
entering.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>2. Figure out how you can use what you have. As I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>just indicated, making
a list of what one can do is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>important. You need to
know your strengths and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>weaknesses, your limitations
and potentials. After making</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>this list, you must
weed out what will not work. For</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>example, while I was
at BLIND, Inc., making a grilled</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>cheese sandwich was a
major undertaking. Now I cook all</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>kinds of things,
ranging from Nigerian cuisine to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>homemade peach sherbet
to ordinary fare. Could I start a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>business preparing
some kind of food and selling it?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well, maybe, but in
looking at this idea I found</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>obstacles, in that
cooking--though I enjoy it--is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>physically very tiring
for me. It would be an inefficient</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and fatiguing venture
at best, even though I could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>perhaps be said to
have abilities in that area.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>3. Don't be afraid to do more than one thing. In</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sorting out what I
could and could not do, I was left</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with three things
which were all of great interest to me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and which I felt had
business possibilities. So I came up</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with a business which
uses all three things. They are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>separate entities, but
I earn money from all of them. In</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>my case my business,
consists of transcription of print</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>material into Braille
and onto cassette tape, speaking to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>groups about the needs
of people with disabilities, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>writing music. I love
this arrangement. There is great</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>variety in what I am
doing, and there is no possibility</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of my becoming bored.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>4. Put together a business plan. I received funding</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for my computer and
embosser through <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">State</st1:PlaceType></st1:place></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Services for the Blind.
They first required me to have a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>small business plan. I
had not a clue about what such a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>plan should include,
so I contacted SCORE, which is a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>volunteer organization
made up of retired business</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>executives who assist
people in starting their own</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>businesses. In one
meeting I learned what kind of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>information should be
in the plan. I would advise using</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>SCORE or another
business expert to check your completed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>plan and assist you in
formulating it. Items in your plan</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>can include, but are not
limited to, reasons why you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>think you should go
into business, your background, your</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>resum&#8218;, a
statement about the nature of the proposed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>business, a
description of your marketing plan, your</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>projected expenses in
beginning the business, and your</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>projected revenue.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>5. Don't become discouraged about money. Several</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>blind individuals have
called me during the last year</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with business ideas.
None of them has had money to use to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>obtain the necessary
equipment to begin the business</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>venture. I obtained
money from my state agency for the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>blind. This avenue is
available to many people. However,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it is not something
that happens overnight. I had to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>contact my counselor
repeatedly in order to make anything</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>happen. I returned to
him time and time again with what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I wanted to do, and
with others from BLIND, Inc.,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>speaking up on my
behalf, things eventually moved. If one</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>source tells you
&quot;no,&quot; keep trying. Don't be afraid, for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>example, to go to a
supervisor. Know your rights. Know</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>what you as a client
of the agency are entitled to before</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>beginning to pursue
what you want. Return to the &quot;no&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>answer with a desire
to find out why it was given. Then</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>counter that argument.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Don't give up if your state vocational</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>rehabilitation agency
is not the way to go. Most states</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>have a small business
agency, which has lots of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>information about how
to start a small business. Thanks</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to the Americans with
Disabilities Act, people with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>disabilities are a
minority, a protected class, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>therefore eligible for
many small business grants. Pursue</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>these.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>6. Know what you would consider success. If in your</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>small business plan
you have determined that you need to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>make a certain income,
reach for this goal, but be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>realistic. Success for
one person is not the same thing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>as it is for the next.
For example, I want to make enough</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to supplement my
Social Security Disability Insurance.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of other
disabilities, it's not practical for me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to get out of the
system, but I can still earn the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>monthly amount
allocated. I consider that success. Others</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>would want to earn far
more money in order to consider</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>themselves successful.
Decide what to aim for, and make</p>

style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it realistic for your
own circumstances.</p>

</span>7. Don't drop everything to start the business. Did</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>you know that it takes
an average of five years for most</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>small businesses
really to start showing a consistent</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>profit? This is, of
course, an average, so it isn't</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>always accurate. But
just because your business is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>starting, don't leave
another job, for example, until you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>know you will have a
regular income from your business.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>8. Prepare for feast or famine. I have found in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>last year that there
are times when I am not particularly</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>busy and times when I
feel quite overwhelmed with the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>amount I have to do. This
feast-or-famine business takes</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>some getting used to.
Don't worry if there isn't a lot to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>do; it will come.
Balancing your life when there is an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>abundance of work can
also be a problem. At times I have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>had to struggle to
keep from working every waking hour.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's only a job, so
don't get caught in the unhealthy</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>loop of working all
the time simply because you work out</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>of your home. When I'm
not busy, I work on no-deadline</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>things which have been
sitting around for a while, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>when I'm swamped, I
get things done while trying to stick</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>to an eight-hour work
day.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

</span>9. Let your business go where it takes you.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes we get ideas
of how things should be, and we</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>want to stick to the
plans we have made. I have found</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that flexibility is
essential in business. It may simply</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>be that I am a
creative person and think in those terms,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>but I have found my
business taking me in directions I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>never would have
dreamed it would. Almost all of my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>speaking to groups
about disability has, for example,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>been made possible
because of word-of-mouth contacts. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>have done very little
marketing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>One day, while I was reading my mail, I got a card</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>from a real estate
company advertising their services. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>dropped it into the
trash but did not drop the thought:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I wonder if there is
any way I could market my teaching</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>about disability to
people in this field? I did some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>digging, found out
where people in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Minnesota</st1:place></st1:State>
become</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>licensed as real
estate agents, and made a cold call to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the executive
director. I asked if anyone had taught a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>course dealing with
the way one assists disabled</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>customers and issues
related to accessibility in housing.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He said, &quot;Write a
proposal; that sounds interesting.&quot; I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did and got a
lucrative contract out of the deal. They</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>have since hired me to
do a number of other classes</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>dealing with aspects
of real estate and fair housing,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>which only indirectly
have to do with disability. This</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>means that I am
delving into new areas requiring</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>research, which I am
having to learn starting at the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>bottom. However, I
would not be involved with this if I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>had not let my creativity
take me in this direction and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>if I had not then used
the opportunities presented to me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

</span>10. Be confident. I cannot emphasize this last point</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>enough. Be confident,
be confident, be confident. I have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>made many mistakes
along the way. I have constantly</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>learned new things,
ranging from more efficient ways to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

evaluating how I can improve public</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

audience critiques. However, that is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>not what I let people
know. The biggest drawback I have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>noticed when talking
to potential entrepreneurs is that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

Editor: The kindest word I could apply to my high school biology course would
be &quot;undistinguished.&quot; The book was large and uninteresting, and the
experiments were boring and smelly. Despite these disadvantages, biology seemed
the least demanding alternative when I had to choose a course to fulfill my
college science requirement. Imagine my astonishment, then, when I discovered
that biology was rivetingly interesting. Swept away in the enthusiasm of this
discovery, I actually declared a biology major. Eventually I began to consider
what I might do with the major. I recognized that I did not possess the burning
passion that would carry me through graduate school, research, and the endless
battles for the right to compete in the field. That seemed to leave high school
teaching. With dismay I recollected Mosshead Manson, who had put us all to
sleep my sophomore year of high school and changed my major to English. But the
entire experience left me with a deep respect for anyone willing and able to
make a success of teaching high school biology.</span></span><span

Although she received avid criticism from teachers and peers who called her

lives,&quot; said Ms. Negri. While studying anatomy in college, she used
cadavers and models to substitute for the pictures and diagrams her classmates
used. All material was left to memorization; she was even responsible for the
unseen physical descriptions of what was placed under the microscope.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

with Atlantic Aerospace Electronics Corporation.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>At the 1993 Convention of the National Federation of
the Blind he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>described the way in which he got his job and a
little of what he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>does. This is what he had to say:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Earlier in the week my
voice started to go a little bit, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I was concerned that I wasn't going to be able to
speak this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>afternoon. The reason I was having trouble with my
voice was that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>every time somebody mentions <st1:State w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:State>,
<st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Connecticut</st1:place></st1:State>,
or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Maryland</st1:place></st1:State>,
of course I have to cheer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am a computational
electromagnetics scientist, whatever</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that means. Hopefully, by the end of this talk,
you'll at least</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>understand that probably you don't want to be one
too. The man</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>who started this science a number of years ago--in
fact it was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>1875--was James Clerk Maxwell. In that year he
published his</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>treatise on electricity and magnetism. I'm going to
read to you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the first two sentences of his preface. &quot;The
fact that certain</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>bodies, when rubbed, tend to attract other bodies
was known to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the ancients. In modern times a great variety of
other phenomena</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have been observed and are related to the phenomenon
of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>attraction.&quot; I wonder how many copies of that
book he sold to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>people who didn't read past that point.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our company we work
in general on electronic warfare.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What that means is that you're a lot better off in
the Army or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Air Force or the Navy or the Marines if the
enemy cannot find</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you or communicate amongst themselves. Being good at
electronic</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>warfare means you save the lives of not only your
own people, but</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>also those of the enemy. I consider this to be a
good thing, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it is how I justify my job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I started out in
electrical engineering at the age of six. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had an odd father. I don't know whether he ever
learned a bedtime</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>story or not, but when he would come up to tuck me
in to bed, he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would say, &quot;Now Michael, you have a five-volt
source and a five-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ohm resistor. The current times the resistance is
equal to the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>voltage; what's the current?&quot; And I would
guess, of course. The</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>only number I knew was one, and it was the correct
answer. The</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>problems progressed until I was through high school.
They kicked</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>me out of electronics class my sophomore year
because I had</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>already mastered all of the material through senior
year. When</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you start at the age of six, you have a bit of a
jump.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In college I tried to
be something other than an electrical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>engineer. I tried to study chemical engineering and
go on to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>physics for a Ph.D., but the bias was just too
strong. I ended up</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in electrical engineering. And since I wanted to get
a Ph.D., in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>May [of 1992] I actually received the degree. Then I
proceeded to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>look for a job in the worst economy that we have
seen in a long</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>time. In ten years of post-secondary school I
couldn't have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>picked a worse time to graduate. The nine-month
period that I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>looked for a job was challenging and interesting. I
interviewed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for a number of positions.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'd like to tell you
how I landed this position. I was at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the 1993 Washington Seminar and got a call on my
answering</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>machine in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pennsylvania</st1:place></st1:State>
from Atlantic Aerospace, and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>immediately called them back, and we chatted about
some technical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things--can you use a computer? I said I preferred
not to. I told</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>them I was down in the <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> area, which is where the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>company is located, and I'd be glad to stop by and
talk with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>them. They were a little busy. They had a trip to
Advanced</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Research Projects Administration (ARPA)
planned.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I said, &quot;I'm</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>down here with the National Federation of the Blind,
and we're</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>meeting with Congressmen this week, talking about
legislative</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>issues. I'll be here through Wednesday.&quot; We
tried to schedule an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>interview for Wednesday afternoon, but of course a
number of us</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>were planning to go to New York for the hearing in
the New York</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>law suit, and I wanted to be a part of that. I told
them that I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would be leaving for the National Center on
Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They said &quot;Call
us sometime on Thursday, and maybe we can</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>work something out for Friday.&quot; So on the road
to New York, I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>went to a pay phone and called and heard, &quot;No,
we can't schedule</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>anything. We'll be in touch with you.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I said, &quot;We're in
New York for this hearing for the National</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Federation of the Blind, and I'll be going to New
Hampshire after</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that.&quot; When I got there, I called them again. I
said that I was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>now in New Hampshire. We had a long, technical
interview this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>time. We talked about the finite element technique
for solving</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>magnetic problems. I told them that I'd done it
before; then I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>went and looked it up. Towards the end of the
conversation he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>said, &quot;You know, you keep mentioning that
you've been doing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>activities with the National Federation of the
Blind; are you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>involved in that organization?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I said, &quot;You
could say that. I am the Connecticut affiliate</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>president.&quot; (Of course, I hadn't spent any of
this time in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Connecticut.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then he said, &quot;Do
you have a dog or a cane?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I said, &quot;Yes, I
have a cane.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He said, &quot;Well I
suppose you wouldn't have to go to any</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>conferences on your own.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And I said, &quot;Hold
on a second here. I called you in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Washington, D.C.; I talked to you when I was on my
way to New</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>York City; now I'm in New Hampshire. How do you
think that I got</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to all these places?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I was on the plane for
an on-site interview the next week. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had my worst interview ever because I was sick at
the time. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>just kept telling them that I was sick and that I
really wasn't</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thinking straight, but it was apparently a
successful interview.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They contacted my advisor, and he said that I had
done all this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>stuff in computational electromagnetics before,
backing me up on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that one. I appreciated that. I ended up getting
snowed in in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Baltimore, and you can imagine how much of a tragedy
it was,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>having to spend time with my friends around
Baltimore! Before I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>got home, I had a job offer. [applause]</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They wanted me right
away, so I took a week to wrap up some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>business for the Connecticut affiliate and headed to
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Washington area.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The job I ended up
working on at Atlantic Aerospace is the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>computation of the radar cross section of a radome.
I am in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>antenna design group. Antennas come in all shapes
and sizes. If</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you stick an antenna on an aircraft and you don't
cover it with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>something and you go Mach II, that antenna is going
to be left</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>somewhere behind you because it will just get blown
right off the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>aircraft. Additionally, antennas are good at picking</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>electromagnetic waves out of the air. Light is made
up of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>electromagnetic waves. They come in a great variety
of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>frequencies, like color. An antenna picks these
electromagnetic</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>waves out of the air. It also has the job of
transmitting them</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>into the air. As a result of these two processes, if
you send an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>electromagnetic wave at an antenna, it reflects a
larger</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>electromagnetic wave, which means that, if you're
the enemy, you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can find an antenna very easily--it has a large
radar cross-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>section. So you have two reasons why you want to
hide this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>antenna: one is that it will blow off the aircraft,
and the other</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is that it appears very large on a radar screen. So
you put a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>plastic bubble over it. But the plastic bubble also
has a large</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>radar cross section, and nobody really
understands--it's all</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Maxwell's fault. Nobody really understands how to
design radomes</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>very well. It's a black art.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So they said,
&quot;Mike, we need a computer program to analyze</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>these electromagnetic waves that scatter from a
radome.&quot; I worked</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for a couple of weeks on some theories and did some
computations</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>on how long it would take a computer to solve this
problem. For</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>example, it would take a Cray computer, which is
very fast, let's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>say one gigaflop (one billion floating point
operations per</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>second), about one year to solve any problem of
interest. I was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>beginning to fear for my job! I thought nobody would
want to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>invest that much time in such a project. But since
I've been</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>working on this problem, through some mathematical
tricks I have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>gotten the problem down to one that would maybe take
a week to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>do. Somebody might be willing to wait around a week
for the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>answer, so I feel that my job is safe for now. I am
not certain,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>however, that it will last all that long. We need faster</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>computers. That's all there is to it. But my job is
safe for now.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I hope to get a couple of publications out of it.
And, of course,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>once I have a few publications to show for my work,
what do you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>think I'm going to do? Go back to school--hopefully
as a teacher</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>this time. So it's a pleasure being in Maryland now,
and I thank</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you for your attention.</p>

<h2><a name=climbingacrop></a>Climbing the Acropolis</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Susan Povinelli</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the Editor: The
following story first appeared in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Summer, 1996, issue of the Vigilant, the
publication of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the NFB of Virginia. Susan Povinelli is an engineer
by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training. She works for the United States Navy. She,
her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>lawyer husband, and their children live in the
Virginia</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>suburbs of Washington, D.C., and are active in the
Virginia</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>affiliate. This is what Susan says:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I climbed the
multitude of steps to the top of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Acropolis in Athens, Greece, I thought of all the
ancient</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Greek philosophers who climbed this path to the
summit to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sit and contemplate the meaning of life. I reflected
on the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wisdom of those ancient philosophers. Now I reflect
on how I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>took that opportunity to travel to Greece.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April, 1993, I was
offered a job with my agency's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training group as a training system manager to support
one</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of our foreign military sales programs. I remember
spending</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>one sleepless night contemplating two great
philosophical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ideas. The first was the general public's philosophy
of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blindness: that because of helplessness a blind
person</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>cannot travel independently and conduct business in
a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>foreign country. The other was the National
Federation of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Blind's philosophy that a blind person with the
proper</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>skills and training can travel independently and
accomplish</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a multitude of jobs. I recalled a blind colleague's
struggle</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to enter the foreign service, and I decided that, if
he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>could travel abroad independently, so could I. So I
accepted</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the position. That sleepless night was not the last
time</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>these two competing philosophies would come into
conflict</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>around me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About a month after I
started the new job, a discreet</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>effort was made to transfer me out of it. The old
philosophy</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of blindness had reared its head again. Questions
were</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>raised. How would the customer perceive and react to
a blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>manager? How would a blind person be able to
interpret</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>nonverbal communication? I assured them, as I had
done many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>times before, a blind person using good management
and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blindness skills could do the job efficiently. As
for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>nonverbal communication, there would be others
available to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>advise me on any matter I had missed--nonverbal</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>communication or technical issues.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Let me briefly
describe what I do as a training system</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>manager. When a customer (foreign government)
procures an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>aircraft, its personnel need to learn how to
maintain and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>fly that aircraft. The training team and I develop a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training program and then implement it. I
incorporate the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>following techniques in my job:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I use Braille
throughout my work. Pricing data are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>developed with a computer spreadsheet program, which
I then</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>translate into Braille using the Duxbury translation
program</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>on my MacIntosh computer. This allows me to
reference the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>data while on the phone or in a meeting. I use
Braille</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>briefing sheets that correspond to the printed view
graphs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>These are notes for my brief.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My job requires that I
travel to the customer's country</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and assess the facilities where the training will be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>conducted. This survey is usually conducted by a
team of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>technical experts. The experts and I look at the
facility.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The expert points out what is wrong and what is
right. We</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>then discuss items needing correction and develop a
plan to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>remedy the problem.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the management
tools used is a milestone chart.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>This graphically displays each event by its
duration. For</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>years I was baffled about how to make raised-line
drawings</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>quickly and inexpensively. I learned to use a
child's screen</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>board (a piece of cardboard with wire window screen
placed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>over it). A member of my support staff places the
milestone</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>chart on top of the screen board, traces the
milestone chart</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with a crayon, and labels the events in Braille.
This same</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>technique could be used for floor plans, engineering</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>drawings, or any diagram which has few details.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now that you know what
I do and how I conduct my job,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it is time to catch an airplane and fly to Greece. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>remember the first time I went. The rest of my team
was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>already there, and I had to make the trip alone.
Once again</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the two philosophies clashed. Airline personnel,
especially</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in foreign lands, believe that a blind person cannot
travel</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>independently and find the boarding gate. Most
airlines have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>policies to escort the blind person to an assist
lounge or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to chairs outside the boarding gates. The questions
that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>plagued me were, would accepting assistance impede
my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>independence? Would I miss my connection and spend
the night</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in John F. Kennedy Airport? Could I catch a taxi in
Athens</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>if no one met me at the airport?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I realized that the real
problem was not my blindness</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>but my lack of Greek. I was more frightened of not
being</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>able to communicate than of getting lost in an
airport. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>frequently use the airport assistance services when
I travel</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>alone because I know it is the most efficient way to
travel</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>through large airports, especially in Frankfurt,
where I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>know there are no chairs outside the boarding gates
and the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>airport is so large that dragging around carry-on
luggage is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>difficult.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I can proudly claim
that I have made that trip across</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Atlantic several times alone. As I was standing
next to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the rock from which Saint Paul was supposed to have
preached</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Christianity to the ancient Greeks, I wondered what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>important message I had to share. At the time
nothing came</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to mind. But a few weeks later, as I was giving a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>presentation on blindness to my children's school, I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>recognized it: being blind is not a tragedy. With
the proper</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>skills and alternative techniques, a blind person
can live a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>successful and productive life.</p>

Hall, another second-grader, agreed. &quot;There are other things to do really
great art work besides using crayons or paints or markers,&quot; she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
for their teacher's not being able to see and needing Braille labels to
identify their work, Gavin, also second grade, said he was not sure what to
expect.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;Maybe
that they're going to mess up. I don't know anybody blind except her,&quot; he
said of Blatter.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Along
with teaching new art techniques, Blatter said she also gave children an
understanding about blindness. Only about fifteen percent of blind people live
in total darkness. Most see degrees of light, she said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
demonstrated the perceptions of various blind people by giving children waxed
paper or cardboard tubes to peer through. She also showed them Braille books,
how she could navigate with a cane, and other devices blind people used.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>&quot;You
noticed I opened my watch and felt it,&quot; she told the children, as she
checked the time for class to start. &quot;It's a Braille watch, and guess what
happens when you raise your hands?&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
children cheered when they heard that art class with Blatter was a time when
they needed to call out their answers, instead of raising hands and waiting for
her response. Travis Norgaard, said the words &quot;blind artist&quot; sounded
like opposites when they were put together.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Blatter,
forty-six, said she had always been interested in art, but when she was in
school, teachers did not think it was realistic for a legally blind youngster
with less than 10 percent vision to pursue such a career. &quot;I used to do
sort of a Monet style with this paper and paint,&quot; she said. Since then,
Blatter said, researchers have discovered that several of the famous impressionists
such as Henri Matisse, Claude Monet, and Vincent Van Gogh probably had vision
problems.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
earned a degree in special education and a master's degree in rehabilitative
counseling, continuing her art on the side. &quot;I've developed a technique of
tactile collage,&quot; she said. &quot;I tend not to use paint with kids at
all. I teach them to use alternate materials.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
said she could see bright colors, but much of the appeal of her art was in
touching the surface. When she exhibits her works, Blatter said, she always
puts up a sign, &quot;Please touch.&quot; That was something she said she
always wished to do when she was a child. &quot;Adults are like, `Oh, my gosh,
are you really sure,'&quot; she said with a smile. But children have no such
inhibitions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>A
native of New York state, Blatter worked as an artist in various parts of the
country before moving to South Dakota in 1996. She now lives in Sioux Falls.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>She
said she had some qualms when she applied for the Artists-in-Schools program.
&quot;Early on I thought, who would take me seriously? I'm blind, and I don't
have an art degree,&quot; she said. &quot;But it's worked out.&quot; However,
after she submitted her portfolio and slides of her works, the only question
that came up concerned transportation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

following article first appeared in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>January 26, 1996, edition of the Tico Times, an
English-language</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>publication in Costa Rica. Mary Ellen Jernigan's
brother Wayne</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Osborn, who is a professor of Latin American history
at Iowa</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>State University at Ames, was recently in Costa Rica
on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sabbatical leave writing a history of the United
Nations</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>University for Peace, which was established there in
1980. After</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>seeing the article, he and his wife Ruth visited the
Santa Lucia</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Bakery, met with a number of the blind women
involved in its</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>management and operation, and sampled the products.
They report</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that the bakery is, indeed, a going concern:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Owned and staffed
almost entirely by blind women, La</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Panaderia Santa Lucia provides steady work while
creating a wide</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>variety of tempting breads and pastries.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the south side of
Plaza Vaquez near downtown San Jos&#8218;,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the bakery opened in July, 1993 and, according to
owner Marieta</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Quesada, is the first business in all of Latin
America created by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a group of blind women.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It was very
hard, because we had to convince our families,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>our communities, and our Costa Rican society that
we, being blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>women, could start a business,&quot; she said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The idea for the
bakery originated at a series of informal</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>meetings Quesada and a group of twelve other blind
women held to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>share common problems, ideas, stories, and humor.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;It was there
that the idea to create work for ourselves was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>born,&quot; Quesada explained. Three members of the
group, including</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Quesada, work at the bakery. All have been blind
from birth,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>suffering from a condition known as pigmentary
retinosis</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>[probably retinitis pigmentosa]. In Quesada's case,
she was able</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to see well enough as a child to learn to read,
write, and draw.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Each day, however, her condition deteriorates, and
she now works</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with only Braille.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of the women are
from limited economic backgrounds, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the majority are married with children or are single
mothers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>They also all come from large families, are Ticas in
their early</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thirties, and live in various parts of San
Jos&#8218;.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The women fittingly
adopted the name Santa Luc&iexcl;a, patron</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>saint of the blind, for their business venture.
According to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>legend, the daughter of a wealthy family was opposed
to her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>arranged marriage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the time came for
the wedding, she fell to her knees,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>praying, and offered God her beautiful eyes if He
would save her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>from this doomed marriage. Santa Luc&iexcl;a
appeared, took her vision,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and saved her. When the palace guards arrived to
carry her away</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by force, they couldn't budge her. From that point
on, Santa</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Luc&iexcl;a has been associated with the blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To open the bakery,
the women had to take out a loan, which</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>they received from a local business, El Productor
RL, after</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>presenting the project to the company. They recently
paid off the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>last of the debt for their machinery and equipment.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although there are two
sighted employees, their duties are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>no more demanding than those of the blind women.
Each woman bakes</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the bread, sells the goods, and cleans the bakery.
Quesada says</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>their job is twice as hard, first of all because
they are women</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>doing a job normally done by men in Costa Rica, and
secondly</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>because they are blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Employees explained
that it has been difficult to make</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>money, and they are just managing to break even.
Salaries are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>approximately $36 a week. Quesada commented that she
is looking</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for additional funding and hopes to be able to move
to a larger</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>building and employ more women.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The women have always
welcomed student volunteers and over</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the past year have opened the doors to six students
from the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Institute for Central American Development Studies
(ICADS)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>program, which offers homestay and volunteer
positions to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>participants and to one student from Kenya through
the Amigos del</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mundo program. Volunteers also have an opportunity
to improve</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>their Spanish.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The bakery primarily
caters to the surrounding community,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>though some tourists occasionally wander in.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among the many
delicious goods are pineapple and chicken</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>empanadas; flautas; pastries with meat, cheese, or

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Crawford is one of the leaders of the National
Federation of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Blind of Iowa. He is also a successful
stockbroker. Here</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is the article as it appeared:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard P. Crawford,
Jr., is Vice President/Investment</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Officer for Dain Bosworth, Inc.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard Crawford's
office at Dain Bosworth looks like</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>most stockbrokers' offices with a few personal
touches.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The head of a deer he
shot a few years ago on a hunting</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>trip graces the wall near a globe. Framed pictures
dot the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>walls. There's a computer, of course, and a
calculator. And,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>leaning on the wall beside the door, there's a white
cane.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Crawford uses it to maneuver beyond his office.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crawford, forty-five,
is totally blind and has been</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>since he was ten. But don't focus on the limitation.
He</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>doesn't.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those who make the
mistake of figuring they can beat</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>him because he's blind sometimes find his handicap
gives him</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>an advantage.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That's what happened
more than once when he was a high</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>school wrestler. In the last few seconds his sighted</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>opponent could see the time clock and would let up a
little.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Crawford, who had no idea that time was running out,
more</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>than once pinned opponents at 5:59.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I never lost
because I was blind,&quot; he says. &quot;I lost</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>because they were better.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The deer on Crawford's
wall is just one example of his</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>refusal to accept his limitations. He's tried
hunting,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>driving a snowmobile, skiing both on water and snow.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He's even driven a
motorcycle--&quot;anytime I can get</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>somebody dumb enough to ride behind me,&quot; he
says. &quot;When I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>snow ski, the guide skis behind me and uses a
walkie-talkie</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and talks me down the mountain.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crawford credits his
parents with much of his success.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;They taught me
the best three-letter word in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>language: try,&quot; he says. &quot;I'll just try
things to see how</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>far I can push my talents and abilities. I can't
find many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>maximums. I can't legally drive a car, but I have
driven.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I've never taken off or landed a plane, but I bet
most other</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>people haven't either.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Crawford's
plumbing breaks or his wife's car needs</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>repairs, he doesn't immediately call for help.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I always screw
it up worse first,&quot; he said. &quot;You'd be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>surprised, though, how often I fix it. It's amazing
what I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can do when I try.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crawford's blindness
is the result of a progressive eye</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>disease. For the first few years, he says, he was
angry,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rebellious, and resentful.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>OK to be blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Thank goodness I
outgrew it,&quot; he says. &quot;You have to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>get to acceptance, and you can't do that until it's
okay to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>be blind.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crawford earned a
bachelor's degree at Wartburg College</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in Waverly, Iowa, and a master of business
administration</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>degree at the University of South Dakota, which he
earned</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>while working full time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He and his wife Sara,

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and two sons.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Almost twenty years
ago he decided he wanted to find an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>occupation that earned him more money. When he
applied to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>become a stockbroker, he wasn't asked how he would
solve all</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the problems he'd face on the job. Instead, he was
told what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it took to be a successful stockbroker.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I said I could
do that,&quot; Crawford said. But he had no</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>idea how.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At first he needed an
assistant to help him do what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>other brokers consider simple tasks, such as
scanning the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ticker for quotes and monitoring market news. He had
a slow</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Braille-printing machine and a talking calculator about
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>size of a typewriter, but neither was quick.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Today he has a
pocket-sized talking calculator, a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>paperless Braille device that reads his computer
screen one</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>line at a time, a Braille printer in case he wants
to take</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>work home, and vocal scanners that can read typed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>information aloud or convert it to his computer,
where he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can read it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

</span>Technology helps</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The technology
is wonderful, and it can give us</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>independence,&quot; Crawford said. &quot;But it doesn't
make us</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>stockbrokers, or accountants, or anything. All they
are are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the tools.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Americans
with Disabilities Act was passed a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>few years ago, the intent was good, but the results
haven't</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>been great, Crawford said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;If you think
that, if you hire me, you will have to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>buy all this equipment, it puts up all kinds of

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Crawford said. &quot;We have a philosophy. Give us
the training,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>give us an opportunity, and let us try. If we can't
give you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>results, then politely fire us.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Job Opportunities for the Blind (JOB) Program,
which is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>jointly conducted by the National Federation of the
Blind and the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>United States Department of Labor. Lorraine Rovig
directs that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>program. Elizabeth Campbell is a hard-working and
energetic</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Federationist who currently serves as President of
the Ft. Worth</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Chapter of the National Federation of the Blind of Texas.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Congratulations to Liz Campbell on her new
assignment and to the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Ft. Worth Star-Telegram for its good sense in
promoting her. Here</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is the story: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elizabeth Campbell has
worked for the Ft. Worth Star-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Telegram for ten years--first in the Metro section,
then for four</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and a half years as a features department writer.
She has handled</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>all kinds of articles: hard-hitting research,
opinion pieces,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>travelogues on landmarks to visit in Texas, society
news, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>assessments of current culture. As fulfilling as her
jobs have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>been, Miss Campbell has long had a wish to combine
her love of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reporting with her knowledge of Spanish and of the
Hispanic</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>community in Texas. Now her chance has come.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 4 the Ft.
Worth Star-Telegram published the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>first edition of La Estrella (Es-stray-ya). This new
bilingual</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>section of the daily paper appears every Friday. A
whole new</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>department has been created to handle the work, with
Miss</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Campbell and one other reporter working full-time.
They will be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>assisted by a city editor and several part-time copy
editors and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>translators. Miss Campbell said that the Ft. Worth
paper is among</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the first in the United States to try this idea. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some of the stories in
La Estrella will be in Spanish and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>some in English, depending on the subject and
source. For</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>example, articles such as soccer scores from South
America might</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>be published in Spanish while articles on Texas
politicians might</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>run in English. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Miss Campbell is
enthusiastic about this new venture. She</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>said she believes she was chosen for the project
because of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>many story ideas she developed and wrote on issues
of interest or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>concern to Texans in the Texas Hispanic community.
Miss Campbell</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had this recommendation for other blind persons who
have a long-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>time dream assignment--she said it's a good idea to
take every</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>opportunity within the scope of your present job to
show your</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ability to do the dream position. Find ways to let
management</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>know of your other talents.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now Miss Campbell is
on a search for computer equipment with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>both Spanish and English voice-output devices. As a
part of its</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reasonable accommodation to the fact that she is
totally blind,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Ft. Worth Star-Telegram has offered to purchase
such programs</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>if they exist. Miss Campbell would also be
interested in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>networking with other individuals who use both
Spanish and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

Editor: Susan Povinelli is one of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>leaders of the National Federation of the Blind of
Virginia. She</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is also an aerospace materials engineer working for
the U.S.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Navy. Last year a group of Federationists, many of
them engineers</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and all fans of the television program &quot;Star

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>themselves into a fan club with particular interest
in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>portrayal of blind people in science fiction and,
more broadly,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in the mass media generally. The group chose as its
name Geordi's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Engineers, in admiration of the blind engineer in
&quot;Star Trek: the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Next Generation.&quot; Susan Povinelli serves as

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>5503 Ashbourne Rd., Apt. 2, Baltimore, Maryland
21227. Here is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mrs. Povinelli's account of one engineer's
experience: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I imagine the reason
most people enjoy &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Trek: the Next Generation&quot; is the series' theme
of exploring</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>strange new frontiers. Since I am a blind aerospace
materials</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>engineer, you might say that I am a pioneer in my
own right.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Twenty years ago no
blind person, and very few women,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ventured into the field of materials engineering.
This is the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>field which studies the physical properties of
various materials-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>-such as metals, adhesives (glue), and plastics--and
uses them in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>engineering applications. Like the first pioneers
who migrated to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the New World, I also do not consider myself to be
achieving</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>anything amazing or out of the ordinary. It was just
a dream that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I wanted to fulfill for my own satisfaction. Like
the first</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>pioneers I did not travel the road to the frontier
alone; I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>traveled with other blind people who believed that
we could live</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>successful, productive lives. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again like the first
pioneers who traveled to the New World,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my voyage has not been filled with exciting
adventures, but I can</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>give you a glimpse of some of the obstacles I have
encountered</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>throughout my career. The first one appeared when I
was a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>teenager. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the age of
seventeen I learned that I had retinitis</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative hereditary condition
that affects</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the retinas. The doctors told my parents, but not
me, that in ten</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>years I would become blind. In their wisdom or their
inability to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>accept my fate, my parents allowed me to continue to
dream of a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>career in engineering. I enrolled in college and did
all the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>usual things engineering students do, but my tunnel
vision and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>night blindness continued to worsen.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>It wasn't until I was about
to graduate from college that I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>realized how difficult it was going to be to obtain
a job in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>materials engineering as a blind person. Private
industry did not</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>want to take the risk of hiring a blind engineer. I
weathered a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>period of self-doubt and gloom. I wish I had known
then about the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>National Federation of the Blind. In my moments of
optimism,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>however, I kept dreaming of a career in engineering.
Finally I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was offered a position as a materials engineer with
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Department of the Navy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do my job by using
ideas I've come up with and by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>borrowing ideas from other blind engineers I've met
through the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>NFB. Four years ago the Navy purchased a speech
program to enable</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>me to continue using my computer. Instead of reading
the screen</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with my eyes, I can read it by listening to a
synthetic voice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Such technology was unavailable when I entered
college in 1978--</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>except on &quot;Star Trek&quot; or in science
fiction movies. In my job I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>spend many hours preparing written correspondence,
and this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>technology has improved the quality and quantity of
my productive</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>work. But with all its advantages it has not taken
the place of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my many years of learning how to read and write.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This leads me to
another obstacle that I had to circumvent.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>As the years went by, my eyesight continued to
deteriorate. I was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>afraid of losing the ability to read and write.
Without a method</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to make notes to myself, read recipes, write to
friends, and read</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>stories to my children, I knew I would have a very
meager</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>existence. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Engineers are
practical people. There is an obvious</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>alternative to being illiterate when you cannot see
print. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>began to learn Braille when I was in college. I had
several</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>classes from a social worker, and the rest was just
practice.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Today I find Braille very useful for taking notes
during</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>meetings, giving a technical brief, and living a
very full life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Somehow I find time for my professional career, my
family of an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>attorney-husband and two children, my responsibility
as the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>secretary of the Potomac Chapter of the NFB, and my
work as chief</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of Geordi's Engineers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My job has provided me
with many wonderful opportunities to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>be resourceful and to reach for new horizons.
Recently we were</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reviewing engineering drawings. These are a series
of large</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>drawings which give the breakdown of assemblies into
their</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>individual components and the manufacturing
procedures to process</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>these parts. Most people would assume that a blind
person could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>not understand such drawings. As a colleague and I
reviewed them,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>he described each level of the drawings and the way
in which each</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>component was configured to the others in the
assembly. This</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>exercise is no more difficult than explaining a
drawing over the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>telephone to another engineer.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have also had the
opportunity to visit the flight line and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>get my hands on real hardware. I have traveled
through many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>manufacturing and repair facilities. I imagine I
received strange</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>looks from workers on the floor while the engineer
showing me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>through the plant explained the operations.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Like the U.S.S.
Enterprise, which boldly explored strange</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>new galaxies to discover new worlds, blind persons
of this and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the next generation can explore job opportunities in
the physical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sciences and discover careers in engineering and
mechanics. Great</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>as Geordi's adaptive aids are, we don't need to wait

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Pennsylvania, that he was one of that year's
winners. His file</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was impressive. In addition to his academic work in
a field which</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I could not fathom, he indicated that he had been a

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>were inefficient and cobbled-together. In short, I
did not hold</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>out much hope for his future despite his impressive
academic</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>record. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am learning,
however, that one should never underestimate</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the power of the Federation's impact on a person of
character and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>determination. Ken looked around that summer at the
first truly</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>competent blind people he had ever seen and decided
that he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wanted what they had. He took himself off to a
rehabilitation</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>program in which he really could master Braille and
the use of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the white cane. He earned a master's degree from
Cornell in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>aerospace engineering, and he began looking for a
job. He found</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>one in data base management at the Naval Ship
Systems Engineering</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Station in Philadelphia. But he has continued to
nose around for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>something that would lead more directly toward
aerospace program</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>management.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, he began working as a Job Opportunities</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for the Blind volunteer in Pennsylvania, which
helped him to hone</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>his own skills in job-hunting. Now it is all paying
off. Here is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a letter which explains what has happened and puts
it all in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>perspective: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>September 18,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>1990</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Dear President Maurer: </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It has often been said
that change is the only true</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>constant. I guess this is so. At any rate, I'm not
doing anything</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to disprove this philosophy. On 21 October, I shall
be starting</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>work at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in the
Space Data and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Computing Division.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My job will involve researching
and interpreting data from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the archives in response to the queries of
astronomers. The data</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>from all American (and some foreign) space missions
is stored in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>these archives. It's time to put some of my
undergraduate</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training to work.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It's not exactly what
I want, but it gets my foot in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>door. I had hoped to get into the space program from
the military</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>side. Oh well, there's more than one way to skin a
cat. I hope to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>move into management. (Based on my experience in
government, this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is an area where my talents are desperately
needed.)<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I plan to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>do a superior job, to learn what opportunities are
available or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can be made, and to use some political finesse to
make helpful</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>allies. Who knows? With a lot of hard work and a
little luck, I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>might get to fly. After all, when the space station
becomes a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reality, they're going to need a lot of disciplines,
not just</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>fliers. I know this is a lot of dreaming. But, if
you don't shoot</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for a target, you won't ever hit it.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A lot has happened
since my first NFB national convention in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Louisville. I've gone from being a mess to being one
of the best</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in 5 years. Back then, I didn't believe that a blind
person could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>do very much. However, after being touched by the
Federation and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>its leaders that summer, I could only conclude that
Ken Silberman</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>couldn't do very much. And I was not prepared to be
content with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that. There was only one thing to do--get off my
backside and get</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to work. Well, this job is the result. Not bad,
eh?<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I close this
letter, I am struck by the fact that I could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>not have achieved any more if I had been sighted. Of
course, it</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would have been much easier if I had not had to
overcome the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>handicap of the professionals who did their best to
set up road-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blocks in front of me. But, with the help of the
Federation, I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have done it. The proof of the pudding is in the
tasting. I've</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>earned this job. I deserve it. And I've got it!</p>

<h2><a name=paige></a>UNLIMITED AMBITION: BLINDNESS DOESN'T HOLD BACK
LEGISLATIVE PAGE, LAW STUDENT</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Margaret N. O'Shea<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the Editor:
Parnell Diggs is the Treasurer of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>National Federation of the Blind of South Carolina.
He is also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about to graduate from law school. He is bright,
energetic, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>determined to accomplish whatever he puts his mind
to. Recently,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a member of the South Carolina Legislature
recognized these</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>characteristics and invited Parnell to become a
legislative page</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for the current semester. On Tuesday, January 4,
1994, The State,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a newspaper published in Columbia, South Carolina,
printed the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>following story:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the Legislature
reconvenes this month, Parnell Diggs</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hopes he'll stand out because he's a good page. But
Diggs knows</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>some people will notice him because he's blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Born with impaired vision,
Diggs is legally blind. He uses a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>white cane to help him get around much of the time
but can see</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>shapes and tell light from dark. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diggs considers
blindness one of the characteristics that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>make him who he is. But in his twenty-five years he
has learned</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that people with good eyesight have trouble seeing
blind people</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>as ordinary.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Blind people are
just like everyone else,&quot; Diggs said last</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>week at the State House as he discussed his new job
with state</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Senator Warren Giese, the Republican Richland County
lawmaker who</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hired him as a page for the upcoming legislative
session.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;We all have
different interests and different talents. Some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of us succeed and some of us fail.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I wouldn't be a
good mechanic,&quot; Diggs said, &quot;but there are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>some very good blind mechanics in this state. There
are blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>cardiologists, and I don't think I'd be very good at
that. But,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I'm a good law student. I expect to be a good
lawyer, and I think</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I'll be a good page.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;The important
thing is that I have a chance to prove the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>average blind person can do the average job as well
as the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>average sighted person can.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Growing up in Myrtle
Beach, Diggs discovered what he was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>good at by refusing to let his limited vision keep
him from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>trying to do whatever he chose. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At six Diggs told his
mother he wanted to be president of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the United States some day. Nancy and William Diggs
believed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>their son, she said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diggs learned to play
football and basketball. He also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>learned to play the guitar well enough to make money
performing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>while his friends were earning minimum wage at
menial jobs.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diggs figured the
folks with enough money to go out to eat</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>were about the right age to appreciate music from
the 1960's and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>1970's. So he built a substantial repertoire of easy
listening</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>songs from those decades, charging $50 an hour to
play his guitar</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and sing in restaurants.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diggs learned most of
the songs by listening to old records.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>He figured out a few from sheet music, which his
girlfriend--now</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>his wife--would help him decipher. She would read
the chords, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>he would play them, he said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;Occasionally,
I'd try something I'd never heard, and my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mother would say, `Parnell, you really need to
listen to that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>song,' So I'd listen to it and do it right,&quot; he
said.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But Diggs says what
he's best at is juggling, juggling time.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He plans to work as
page while finishing law school--he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>graduates in May--and clerking for Irmo attorney
Alvin Neal, who</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is also a member of Lexington County Council.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Diggs, who begins as a
page January 11, spent last week at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the State House learning the ropes. But a page's job
description</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is about as broad as any lawmaker's imagination. The
familiar</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>click of the fingers to summon a page could mean
anything.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Giese is known for
assigning his pages unusual jobs--like</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>figuring out how to get school buses bought at
auction from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Spartanburg to Columbia.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hearing that tale,
Diggs said, &quot;I don't think you'd want me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to drive a bus, but I think I can handle just about
anything else</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you want me to try.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Giese says he's
excited about the chance to work with Diggs,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>whom he noticed through his interest in the state
chapter of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>National Federation of the Blind. Diggs was elected
treasurer of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the statewide organization when he was twenty-four.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;What I look for
in pages is superior people in terms of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>brightness and the ability to be creative and deal
with whatever</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>comes up,&quot; Giese said. &quot;I think Parnell
has all those qualities.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I know he has
interest in law, and I see this as a good</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>opportunity for him to see law developed, as well as
an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>opportunity for those of us who make laws to learn
from him.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And Diggs is no
stranger to the ways of the Legislature.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Since he was a teenager, he has been lobbying for
Braille</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>literacy and other laws to enhance blind people's
lives and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>opportunities.</p>

<h2><a name=autobody></a>EARNING OUR DAILY BREAD: THE BLIND IN AUTO BODY REPAIR</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

Editor: Some of the most lively,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>interesting, and inspirational agenda items at our
national</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>conventions are the presentations made by our own
members who are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>earning their daily bread in occupations that many
people would</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>think closed to blind employees. At the 1992
convention in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Charlotte, North Carolina, one young man captivated
the audience</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with his story of returning to auto body repair
after he became</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind. Now meet Daryel White, vice president of the
St. Louis</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>County Chapter of the National Federation of the
Blind of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Missouri and a first-rate employee at Marty's Body
Works:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm proud to be here
today to tell you a little bit about</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>what I do to earn my daily bread. I'll begin by
telling you where</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I was and how I got to where I am today.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I'm from St. Louis,
Missouri. Approximately five years ago I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>lost my eyesight. For about six months I sat and
thought I was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>never going to amount to anything in life. A rehab
counselor came</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to my home, and by the time he left I was even more
convinced</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that I had no future. Then about six months later a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rehabilitation teacher knocked on my door. I said,
&quot;Who are you?&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It had been about six months since the rehab
counselor had come,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and here she was. She asked me a few questions,
which I answered.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>She said to me, &quot;What did your rehab counselor
tell you?&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I said, &quot;Well, he
looked at me and said I wasn't going to do</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>anything with my life but be what I call a
housewife.&quot; At that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>time I didn't know any different. I had just lost my
sight, and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thought maybe that's all I could ever be. This
bright young lady</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>really impressed me when she first came into my
home. She showed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>me how to do things that I didn't think I could do,
but more than</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>anything else, she told me something I could hardly
believe: she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>said that I could do whatever I wanted to--that I
could do what I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had done before I became blind. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This lady's name was
Patty Page. She introduced me to her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>brother, a man who has taken me as far as I can go
in making my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>life better. His name is Homer Page, and he is
president of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>National Federation of the Blind of Colorado and one
of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Boulder County Commissioners. I went to meet him
while he was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>visiting at his sister's home. I'll remember this
till the day I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>die; we were sitting at his sister's table, and he
asked me what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I wanted in life. I told him that I wanted to do
what I had been</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>doing when I was sighted--have my own home, have my
own job, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>live as I was then. He looked at me and said,
&quot;You will have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I said
&quot;o.k.&quot; But in my mind I thought, &quot;Well, this guy's</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>really lost it.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He went over to the
phone and made a call to a lady who in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my heart has really become like my mother.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I first met her in
Denver when I came off the plane from St.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Louis. I could hardly even walk. I mean I had hold
of this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>stewardess like she was my savior! When I got into
the gate area,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>this woman came up to me and said her name was Diane
McGeorge.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Then she took me with her--here I am, totally blind,
and she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>says, &quot;I'll take you to get your luggage.&quot;
And she was totally</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind. I thought to myself, &quot;This lady's lost
it too!&quot; But I hung</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>on to her because I was frightened. We got the
luggage and went</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to her home, and then I went to the apartments for
students at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Colorado Center for the Blind. Diane McGeorge
and Homer Page</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had managed to enroll me as a student at the Center.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From that moment on I
began building my confidence. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>learned how to travel. I had had a cane, but I
couldn't even find</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my feet! The staff helped me with cane travel,
Braille, and self-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>confidence. They also introduced me to the
organization that is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>really my support and backbone today--the National
Federation of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I spent about ten
months in Colorado, and toward the end I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>made some phone calls looking for a job. Even on the
day I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>graduated from the CCB, I made a couple of phone
calls and got</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>turned down. But eventually I got lucky with Marty's
Body Works,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>which is in St. Louis, Missouri. I do auto repair,
paint cars,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and put fenders and doors on. I even do welding. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now I want to tell you
a little story. When I came back from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Colorado Center for the Blind, my confidence
level was taller</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>than the highest building that was ever built, so my
first job</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with the public's eye on me was a hard one. I went
to work for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Marty's Body Works two weeks after I got back from
Denver,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Colorado.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There's a man named
Charlie Collins who owns a big diesel</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>shop in St. Louis. He wrecked his brand new pick-up
truck in a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>front end collision. He had it towed to Marty's. He
looked at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Marty and he looked at me. Then he said, &quot;I do
not, do not want</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that blind man to work on my truck!&quot; Marty
looked at me and kind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of smiled, and Charlie went on home. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then Marty said,
&quot;Daryel, you're going to do that job.&quot; So I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>brought the truck in and did the job. I put it all
together and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>painted it. I mean, I did a superb job. There was
nothing wrong</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with that truck when I got done. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When Charlie came back
to pick it up, Marty told him,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Charlie, I don't want you to pay for that job
right now. I know</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>how you are; I've done work for you before. You take
the truck</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>back to your shop. I want you to check it over just
as close as</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you can for fender and hood gaps.&quot; (These gaps
are the distance</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>between the pieces of the car you build or rebuild.)
He said, &quot;I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>want you to bring it back tomorrow and tell me if
you find</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>anything wrong.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So Charlie took it to
his shop, and he brought it back the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>next day. He said, &quot;Marty, that's the most
fantastic job I've</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ever seen!&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Marty looked at him,
and he looked at me. Then he told</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Charlie right there, &quot;That is what a blind man
can do.&quot; </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charlie owns two
eighteen-wheelers over the road. About two</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>weeks later he wrecked one of his eighteen-wheelers.
He brought</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it back to Marty's, and do you know what his first words
were?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Let that blind man work on my
truck.&quot;<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Sushil Oswal,
Assistant Professor of Technical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Communication at Middle Tennessee State University
(MTSU), found</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>out about this new and growing field in a chance
meeting with a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>practitioner while awaiting eye surgery in
Cincinnati, Ohio. When</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it turned out his sight, lost in a car accident,
could not be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>restored, he decided to pursue graduate study in
technical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>communication because, aside from being interested
in it, he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thought he would have a better chance of finding a
job in a new</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>field which needed qualified people. His
undergraduate training</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had included a good deal of science and engineering,
and he had</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>worked in industry before losing his sight. He
wanted a solution</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>which would offer him a way to pursue his
technological interests</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and to return to industry.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most people think
technical communication is technical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>writing, he explained, but it's really much broader
than that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Technical writing is part of it, but technical
communication also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>includes the methods by which computers talk to each
other and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the way new technology is introduced to workers or
consumers.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>&quot;Some people call technical communication
specialists boundary</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>spanners,&quot; he said, &quot;because we span the
boundaries between new</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>technology, existing technologies, and the people
who are going</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to use technology. I think technical communication
would be ideal</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training for technical sales and support personnel,
for example,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and it helps engineers do a better job both as
engineers and as</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>managers.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Blind people, on the
other hand, have to be not only</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>boundary spanners but also boundary breakers, he
believes. &quot;I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have heard encouraging things through Job Opportunities
for the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Blind about blind people going into fields like
geology or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>chemistry,&quot; he said, &quot;but we should be
hearing about this more</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>often. Unfortunately, many blind people still think
they're</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>limited by what rehabilitation counselors say they
can do or are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>limited because they or their parents or teachers
don't think</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>they can learn math or science. Sometimes people
tell me I could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>get into a field like this only because I was
previously sighted,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>but that just isn't true. One of the people who was
very</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>inspiring to me while I was adjusting to blindness
was a man</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind from birth who was doing graduate work in
chemistry.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Oswal faced some
resistance in graduate school, first</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>from faculty who thought any kind of graduate work
would be too</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>demanding for a blind person, particularly someone
newly blinded,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and later in connection with his doctoral project,
which involved</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>field work in industry. &quot;I solved the problems
blindness might</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have created in the field work by choosing a
cultural</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>anthropology research method instead of statistical
number</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>crunching, but even if I had decided to do
statistical work,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>there are several statistical computer programs
today which work</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>well with speech or Braille. You have to insist on
doing what you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>want to do and then make the effort to find
innovative ways to do</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it. Don't settle for someone else's decision that
you can't.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Oswal insisted on
teaching throughout graduate school,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>despite the advice of those who told him teaching
plus graduate-</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>level research would be too hard. He succeeded
academically</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>despite those predictions, and the teaching
experience he gained</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>as a graduate student was important work experience
when he went</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>looking for a faculty position. (He abandoned his
idea of working</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in industry because large companies were laying off
employees</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>while universities were having difficulty attracting
qualified</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>professors.)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three universities
offered him jobs, but he chose MTSU</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>because he felt the attitude during the interview
process was the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>most positive. &quot;They asked me questions, such
as how I would keep</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>track of my students, because they were curious. But
they assured</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>me they knew I could do it; they just wondered
exactly how. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>told them I would take attendance, and if I ever
found out that a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>student had walked out during class after roll call,
I would</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>recommend that such a student be suspended from
school. I knew</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>from my teaching experience as a graduate student
that, once my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>students got to know me, they would respect me and
have no</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>interest in sneaking out of class.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Oswal uses Braille
for personal notes such as class</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>attendance records, speech for his computer work,
and a scanner</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to deal with print. &quot;I think teaching is by no
means the only</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>area of technical communication in which a blind
person could</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>work. For example, someone interested in computers
who doesn't</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>want to be a programmer could learn to manage a
computer lab or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>could become an entrepreneur who sets up computer
systems for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>small companies or government agencies. Someone
interested in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>writing who gets the necessary science and
technology courses in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>college could be a technical writer. I think a blind
person might</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>even be a better technical writer than someone with
sight,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>because technical writers prepare user manuals for
products, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a blind person really has to study a product
carefully to learn</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>how it works and how to use it. Since the eye is
usually faster</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>than the hand, a sighted person may examine the
product</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>superficially and miss things.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>North Carolina, which has adapted the chemistry lab
for students</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>who are blind and which is willing to share
information with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>students or with other universities. &quot;Students
should also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>remember that you don't necessarily have to see
something with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>your own eyes or do it with your own hands to learn
about it. You</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>can have a classmate in biology explain to you what
he sees and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>what he is doing while he dissects the frog, and
there are some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things you can touch. It will take extra effort, but

<h2><a name=scientist></a>THE BLIND SCIENTIST AT LOS ALAMOS</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by John Rowley, Ph.D.<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>From the Associate Editor: We in the National
Federation of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Blind remind ourselves often that we are changing
what it means</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to be blind in America, and it is most certainly
true. But some</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things seem to take more time to alter than others.
We</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>successfully work for the passage of a law, and the
conditions</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>affected by that law change relatively swiftly. We
persuade one</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>educator teaching blind children of the importance
of early</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Braille and cane instruction, and those youngsters
are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>immediately better off. We establish one training
center that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>bases its instruction on a sound philosophy of
blindness, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>suddenly the blind of the entire area receive a new
lease on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>life.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But some things take a very long time indeed to
change. When</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>attitudes are involved, when an individual or a
family must</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>struggle to find the private courage to take a
difficult course</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of action, then we are reminded just how slowly
progress is made.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Nearly fifty years ago Dr. Jernigan was told by his</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rehabilitation counselor that his ambition to be an
attorney was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>not feasible. Twenty-five years ago I was told that
Advanced</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Placement high school English would be too difficult
for me.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Fifteen years ago a Federationist in Ohio, who did
not then know</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about the NFB, was denied enrollment in an advanced
college</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>chemistry course which she needed for a pre-med
major. And it</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>still happens every day all across this country.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Experts, friends, family, and blind people
themselves conduct</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>well-intentioned campaigns to protect blind
youngsters from the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>strain and stretch of serious challenge. Social
work, teaching</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind children, rehabilitation:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>these are today's safe</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>occupations the ones that make sense for blind
people. In fact</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>some people are gifted in these areas, and some such
individuals</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>happen to be blind. But it is no accident that most
of the blind</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>engineering and science majors who have applied for
Federation</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>scholarships in recent years have had a good bit of
residual</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sight.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>It is desperately important that we not close off
the options for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind children before they have a chance to
determine for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>themselves whether or not they have what it takes in
the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>vocational fields they find attractive, whatever
they are. Dr.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>John Rowley, who addressed the 1989 convention of
the National</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Federation of the Blind on Saturday afternoon, July
8, made this</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>point very clearly when he said that anyone
interested in science</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had better want to do science and be prepared to
work hard at it,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>but that he saw no reason why blind students should
not pursue</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>such careers if they had the dedication to do
so.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>He knows what</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>he is talking about.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>A scientist and engineer for many years before the
onset of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blindness, John Rowley returned to the Los Alamos
Laboratory</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>after completing several months of hard work at the
Louisiana</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Center for the Blind in October of 1988. He was
given his choice</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of several projects and chose one that required his
special</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>combination of scientific and engineering skills. He
was charged</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>with moving to Las Vegas, Nevada, for about two
years to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>establish and strengthen the management office for
the High Level</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Waste Project conducted by the University of
California Los</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Alamos National Laboratory on the west side of the
Nevada test</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>site. The Department of Energy's project here is
supported by the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>University of California, and Dr. Rowley's task is
to hire staff,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>establish the office, compile large technical
documents, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>generally bring to bear his expertise to get the
project started</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>efficiently.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>When he finishes this project late in 1990, he will</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>be assigned another trouble- shooting job. Here is
what he had to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>say about his work as a blind scientist:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;</span>W hat I
want to talk about I have titled Reflections at the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Interfaces. There are really two interfaces I want
to talk about. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One is the type of science I practiced for a third
of a century</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>(well, actually, forty years is probably closer),
and the second</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>one, of course, is the interface between sight and
blindness.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I'll try to touch on two other questions in the
meantime. Should</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>young blind people consider a career in science, and
is blindness</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>an important issue in studying for being a
scientist? I will</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>assert the answer to those two now, and then I'll
try to convince</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you, through my example, that indeed I would
encourage young</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blind people to go into science, but only under
certain</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>conditions. You must really want to practice
science.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>You must</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>prepare yourself thoroughly, and you must be
prepared to work</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>very hard. I don't believe and I think I can speak
from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>experience that blindness is a very important issue
at all in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>practicing science.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Here I must be very careful because I've</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>only been practicing science for about a year as a
blind person.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Actually I think it's added a little bit of spice to
the game.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Some people might say challenge, but science is
enough challenge</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>already, so I think really spice might be a better
term.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>The first interface I want to talk about had to do
with the type</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of science I practiced. Probably it's true that
scientists and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>engineers (and I'm both) do as many different things
as there are</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>individuals.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>By the way, there aren't many of us scientists. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>think there are only a half a million or so (maybe a
little more)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in the country.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>It's a pretty specialized trade. One of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things that I tried to do when I was young was to
learn</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>everything there was about science.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>My parents just thought I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>couldn't make up my mind, which actually was the
truth. You know,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>many young people can't decide exactly what it is
they want to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>do. But I hid that very nicely by studying chemistry
and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mathematics and chemical engineering and physics and
I've</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>forgotten what all else. As a graduate student I
worked on many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>applied projects.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I found applications of science that is,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>engineering quite fascinating. So I really trained
myself in a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>lot of areas during that process of not being able
to make up my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>When the time came to look for a job, I found it
very difficult</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>because it turns out the job market in physics,
chemistry, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>many other fields of engineering is really very
narrow, and that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wasn't my game.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>So I looked around the country (this was in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about 1955), and I found a place which takes
concepts, ideas,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>findings, discoveries that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is, the research aspects of science and converts
them into</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hardware prototypes, working models. That happened
to be the Los</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Alamos National Laboratory.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I've practiced that interface between the two areas
that is,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>research discovery (findings if you will) and the
application of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>these for a third of a century.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Now I'd like to talk about the other interface,
which is a more</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>recent one the interface between blindness and
sight. I perhaps</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was quite fortunate. When I was a teen-ager before
the second</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>world war, I had an ophthalmologist who very
carefully explained</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to me the risk factors to my vision. I was very,
very near</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>sighted, and I used an alternative technique all
those years. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>used glasses<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>refraction, you know.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>And I
actually had no</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>problem. My retinas did not detach, which was one of
the risks.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>And I did not avoid all the things he said not to
do. I enjoyed</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>football, parachuting, and a number of other
activities.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But he</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>also mentioned that maybe, later on in life, the
retinal material</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would deteriorate, although he suggested (and the
literature I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>read at that time suggested) that I might outlive
all that or die</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>before it happened. And so I really didn't ignore
it; I think I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was forewarned and prepared.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>However, in 1982 I noticed my right eye was clearly starting
down</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hill, and I lost my peripheral vision. By 1984 I
believe I was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>essentially blind. The testing was a little nominal,
but I gave</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>up driving at that time. And soon thereafter, I had
to start</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>making a decision.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>At first I thought it was simple. In my</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>laboratory, as far as I'm able to determine,
everyone who was</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blinded or had gone blind before had retired. It
turns out that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>our laboratory has a very generous medical
retirement program</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and, quite frankly, has a very, very tough safety program.
Ours</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is a very hazardous workplace. By the way, we're
also extremely</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>safe people. The two go hand in hand, I might
add.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>So everyone</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>else prior to my case (I use the word lightly,
although my view</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of it was a little tougher than that) had retired.
So I thought I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>would retire. Maybe that was the alternative to
take.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>But you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>know, I really liked work. In fact, I wasn't really
bothered by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the second interface although I was having a little
trouble</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>getting to work, and my productivity was dropping. I
found myself</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>doing different kinds of work still interesting,
still productive</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in some ways, but certainly not with the amount of
reading and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>writing that I was used to. So what did we do?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Well, my wife Mary and I went to a nice retirement
seminar two</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>days delightfully done by our laboratory. At the end
of those two</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>days, I was totally convinced I didn't want to
retire.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Now, how does one manage?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>What is the tactic?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Well I started</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>getting books out of the library on blindness. I
opened a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>notebook on retirement on the one hand; I opened
another notebook</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>on blindness on the other hand. And I found you can
learn</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Braille. So I signed up for a correspondence course.
I got hold</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of the New Mexico Commission for the Blind. An
itinerant teacher</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>came up and said,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Why you know, there's orientation and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mobility.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>(You see, I got the buzz words right away, too, and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>got a white cane.) By the way, I got some literature
about the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>National Federation of the Blind at the same time, I
might add. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>went down to the drugstore and got a pair of
sleepshades because,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>even now, I have a little bit of vision in my left
eye, and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>started practicing. After a few months of that, I
figured that it</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>might take five years if I worked rather diligently
at it, and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>was starting to work quite diligently. So clearly
that wasn't a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>very good way to get from where I was across this
interface. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wanted to be a working scientist, but how to do it?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Well, pretty soon my supervisor got worried, and
with good</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reason.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>I was bumping into things, particularly in unfamiliar</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>areas. I was having trouble in low-light conditions.
My</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>productivity in reading and writing (even though I
tried to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>divert some of my activities away from that) was
getting lower.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Fortunately, he brought up the issue of safety. I
was clearly a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>safety hazard to my laboratory. What was to be done?</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I must say I was a little bit upset about that, but
on the other</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hand, I realized they really were talking about
liability</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>(although, of course, that issue never really came
up). However,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I thought, there must be a way around this. Then it
dawned on me</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that our laboratory has a policy that will pay for
safety</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training. I don't believe they're allowed to pay for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rehabilitation training access, accommodation, all
kinds of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>things, but not rehabilitation. So I explored the
possibility of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>getting orientation and mobility training at the
laboratory. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thought, well I'll take a month or two off, I'll get
somebody</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>good in here. They'll take me all over the lab and
my home area</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>all that. And I'll be safe. I started calling around
the country,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and I was very, very fortunate in contacting, among
other people,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Mary Ellen Reihing (at that time) on the staff at
NFB</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Headquarters. And she said,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>It's an interesting idea. I'll try</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to find you an O&amp;M instructor. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>How lucky I was that she didn't find one! She also
said in her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>own very persuasive (well, not too subtle but very
persuasive)</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>way,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>Really you need six to nine months or perhaps a year of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>good rehabilitation training if you're going to do
what you want</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to do.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I
was convinced.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>I admit that I think
I was very</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>receptive. I have never in my life believed that
blind people</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>couldn't do what they wanted to do. I find out now
there are many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>people who do. I was fortunate, so what to do next?
I made many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>phone calls, talked to many institutions, and
finally I heard</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>about the Louisiana Center for the Blind. To make a
long story</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>short, I called Joanne Fernandes. In November of
1987 we visited</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Center around Thanksgiving time, and I'm very
thankful I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>might add. We found it precisely as described.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>One of the criteria that I established at that time
was that I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>wanted instructors who were blind. I was anxious for
that. I've</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>trained myself in many, many areas before. I've also
trained many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>other people. And I'm firmly convinced that's the
absolute best</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>way to go. I found the Center to be exactly as
represented. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>felt it would totally satisfy my needs. It did,
absolutely. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>spent from January to July last year, 1988, at the
Center; and I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>believe I graduated with some honors. I really
enjoyed that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>experience. I've heard it called a boot camp.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Now let me tell</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you that if you do go through a boot camp, you're
going to know</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>precisely what it is you want to do along with being
able to do</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>it. So, if you have any hesitation about one of the
centers,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>please come and speak to one of the graduates. I
assure you that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>this has changed my life because I think I probably
would have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had to retire had I not gone to that center.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>What happened when I returned to my laboratory?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Well there is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>some indication you can be a nice senior science
advisor you</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>know, kind of a soft nice job demanding in a way,
but not too</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>taxing.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>After
a few months, however, they offered me a position</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>in Las Vegas to solve a very tough problem. I
couldn't resist. I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>have solved lots of problems in the last third of a
century from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>my laboratory. But what a delightful challenge this
was, what a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>blessing. Here I had to do all those things that
Joanne and her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>staff had taught me. I had to find an apartment. I
had to cook</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for myself,<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;
</span>and the cane travel! I must confess, I've tried to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reach as far out into Las Vegas as I can. The strip
is a thing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>you wouldn't believe. I must say, I could tell you a
few stories</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>well never mind. That's a fascinating thing to do.
I've been able</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to extend every one of my skills and use it. The
only one I'm</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>deficient in still is Braille, and I'm going to get
back at that.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>But I suspect it's going to take me perhaps another
year to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>complete solving this problem. We've hired a number
of people,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>got the office set up, and the projects moving.
We're starting to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>produce deliverables.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>The science is coming together. The
people</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>are coming together. And soon, I think, we'll close
this one.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Could I have done that without the NFB?<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>No way! There is no way. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I've looked back and said,<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>Oh, I could have learned all that.<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>There is no way. And I certainly want to thank you
all.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I want to share in closing one small bit of
philosophy that I</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>think we share in common: scientists and the NFB.
That is the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>old, time- honored phrase:<span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>You shall know the truth, and the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>truth will set you free.<span

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>dangerous obstacles.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Caron's lesser-known
passion is her jewelry, which she began</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>creating two years ago to satisfy an artistic
craving.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her tiny apartment is
filled with colorful bags of beads</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>from Italy, Africa, China, and other distant places.
Caron also</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>makes her own beads from raw clay, which she glazes
and fires in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a kiln at a Pompano Beach ceramics shop.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The colorful chokers
and matinee lengths are combinations of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>ivory, hand-blown glass, painted porcelain, jade,
and other</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>special materials. She finds the beads at various
thrift shops.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Caron tests the authenticity of the beads' material
by rubbing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>them together and running her fingers over them.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She takes her cache of
colorful creations to some local art</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>fairs, like the annual Christmas show at Coral Ridge
Mall.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Caron's biggest
triumph as a blind woman, however, took</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>place two years ago when she hesitantly boarded a
plane bound for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Rome--the city she had visited regularly before she
became blind.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I fell in love
with Rome,&quot; she said. &quot;I love the European</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>way of life. I thought I would never get back there
again. In</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>1990, I went back, and I did very well. I got off
the plane, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>I just broke into Italian. I stayed for a
month.&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Caron has been back to
Rome three times and plans to keep on</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>going every spring. Her necklaces have even gone on
sale at the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>American embassy.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;My life is very
full now,&quot; she said. &quot;I do very well at</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>being legally blind. Blind people may have lost
their sight, but</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>they haven't lost their intellect.&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name=medtrans></a>UPDATE ON MEDICAL TRANSCRIPTION AS A CAREER</h2>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>by Susan M. Turley<span style='font-size:10.0pt'><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the Associate
Editor: One day a couple of years ago the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>telephone rang on Lorraine Rovig's desk at the
National Center</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for the Blind in Baltimore. Miss Rovig is the
Director of the Job</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Opportunities for the Blind Program, so this was not
a startling</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>occurrence. But the conversation that followed was
unusual</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>nonetheless. The caller introduced herself as Sue
Turley. She</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>explained that she was taking a course for her
master's degree in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>education, and she was interested in writing a paper
comparing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>some of the discrimination problems faced by women
with those she</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had heard about from the blind medical
transcriptionists with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>whom she worked in her job as Director of Curriculum
Development</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for the Health Professions Institute. Both groups
seemed to her</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to face low wages, lack of advancement, and
presumption of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>incompetence out of all proportion to their numbers.
Could we</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>provide her with information about blindness and the
employment</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>problems that plagued blind people? Of course we
could, and from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that moment there began a mutually helpful
relationship between</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Health Professions Institute and the National
Federation of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the Blind. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of Sue
Turley's new knowledge of and interest in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>difficulties facing blind people training to become
medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>transcriptionists, she began working to insure that
materials</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>produced by the Health Professions Institute were
readily</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>accessible to blind transcriptionists. She worked
with Recordings</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>for the Blind to see that the most up-to-date
editions of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>texts used by her organization were available to
borrowers. She</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>also offered her expertise to any blind job-seeker
contemplating</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medical transcription as a career. Mrs. Turley is
honest and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>candid about what it takes to do the job well. She
is convinced</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>that blind people can and do make good
transcriptionists but that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>they must have good skills to do so. As a Certified
Medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Transcriptionist, a registered nurse, and now the
holder of a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>master's degree in education, she knows whereof she
speaks.<span style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp; </span>In</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>addition, she respects blind people and is not
willing to let</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>people lower the standards of her profession because
a particular</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>trainee is blind. Here is the article that Sue
Turley submitted</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to the Braille Monitor about the field of medical
transcription</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and the opportunities it offers to blind people:</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Medical transcriptionists
are members of the health care</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>team, which includes physicians, nurses, therapists,
and other</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>health care support staff. While not as visible to
the general</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>public as some members of the team, medical
transcriptionists</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>play an important role in providing quality care by
transcribing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reports on patients. Transcribing involves typing a
medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>report from a physician's dictation and, using
medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>terminology, knowledge of English grammar, and
editing skills,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>producing a report that is accurate and complete. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Medical
transcriptionists transcribe office chart notes;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>history and physical examinations; consultations;
letters; memos;</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hospital admission notes; emergency department
notes; operative</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reports; discharge summaries; pathology reports; and
many</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>specialty laboratory, diagnostic, and radiology
reports.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Medical
transcriptionists work in a variety of settings,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>including medical clinics, doctors' offices,
hospitals, private</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>transcription businesses, and home offices. There is
a critical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>shortage of qualified medical transcriptionists
nationwide, and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>they are always in great demand. In general salaries
range from</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>$15,000 per year for those working in doctors'
offices or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>hospitals to $25,000 and above to those with
superior typing</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>skills or those who manage their own medical
transcription</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>businesses. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Medical transcription
is a field which has traditionally</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>been open to blind individuals. Adequate training
has always</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>presented a problem, however. Currently, the need
for</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>comprehensive, in-depth training is critical due to
the explosion</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>of medical knowledge and computer technology, which
must be</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>mastered to function successfully on the job.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prospective trainees
need to have above-average skills in</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>spelling, grammar, typing, word processing, and the
use of a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>speech board, as well as an interest in medicine.
Personal</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>qualities include the ability to work independently
on the job</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>and a commitment to excellence as a member of the
health care</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>team. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Training begins with
courses in anatomy and physiology,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medical terminology, word processing, human
diseases,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>pharmacology, and laboratory tests. Also a most
important part of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the training process is the transcription of
training tapes which</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>contain authentic physician dictation. The national
professional</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>membership organization for medical
transcriptionists, the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>American Association for Medical Transcription
(AAMT), recommends</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the use of authentic physician dictation as well as
study in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>course areas listed above.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Health Professions
Institute of Modesto, California, is a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>nationally known developer and publisher of medical
transcription</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>training and medical reference materials. We are
dedicated to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>making our training materials and reference books
accessible to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>visually impaired medical transcriptionists (VIMTs)
and trainees.</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>For individuals who wish to enter the field of
medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>transcription, Health Professions Institute has
developed an</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>independent study program which can be completed at
home. We have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>selected nationally known textbooks in anatomy and
physiology and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medical terminology and assured that they were
readily available</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>to trainees from Recordings for the Blind. In
addition, we have</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>had RFB record three textbooks on pharmacology,
laboratory</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medicine, and the history of physical examination,
which were</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>written and published by Health Professions
Institute</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>specifically for medical transcription trainees. Our
training</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>tapes are divided into two levels: beginning and
advanced. The</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>twelve-tape beginning course presents an
introduction to the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>science and art of medical transcription and covers
every medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>specialty in the twelve hours of dictation. This
course</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>thoroughly prepares the trainee to work in a
doctor's office or</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>clinic. The advanced units provide hospital-level
training. Both</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>courses are extremely comprehensive, use authentic
physician</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>dictation, and give the trainee competitive job
skills in the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>field of medical transcription. The cost of the
complete</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Beginning Medical Transcription Course is $840. The
cost of the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>advanced course is $210 to $280 per medical
specialty. Although</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>an individual may purchase these courses, many state
vocational</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>rehabilitation agencies have purchased these courses
on behalf of</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>their clients. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span
style='mso-spacerun:yes'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Health Professions
Institute also has developed the</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>following products for our visually impaired
customers and</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>trainees. Our medical word and phrase books, which
are sold by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medical specialty, have been put on computer disk in
response to</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a survey we conducted of VIMTs around the country to
determine</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>which medium they preferred. These word and phrase
books on disk</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>merge automatically with the WordPerfect
spellchecker so that</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>medical documents can be automatically spellchecked.
However,</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>because medical transcriptionists must often search
through a</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>reference book to locate a garbled word from the
dictation, we</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>added a special window to the software which can be
activated by</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a macro. Within this window a speech board can be
used to word</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>search quickly through the actual contents of the
word and phrase</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>book as displayed on the computer screen. Another
popular book</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>published by Health Professions Institute, Current
Medical</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>Terminology by Vera Pyle, is also available on
computer disk with</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>a window feature. This software package will give
VIMTs not only</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>the words found in the book but their definitions as
well. This</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is of great help in determining that the word
selected is</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>correct, given the sound-alike nature of many
medical words. This</p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent>is an extremely important feature for VIMTs and
trainees. </p>

<p class=MsoBodyTextIndent><span

<h2><a name=everlee></a>Black, Blind, and Successful the Story of a Fighter</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
Ever Lee Hairston<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>From
the Editor: Ever Lee Hairston is First Vice President of the NFB of New Jersey
and a longtime Federation leader. She is also the supervisor and administrator
of the Alcohol, Drug, and Outpatient Program for Camden County Health and Human
Services of Cherry Hill, <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State>.
Following the Presidential Report on Wednesday afternoon, July 5, 2000, she
came to the podium to address the convention of the National Federation of the
Blind. Her audience, which had just raptly listened to President Maurer's
stirring annual report of what the organization has been doing to change life
for blind people everywhere, settled back and immediately found itself gripped
by Ever Lee's story. It's impossible to capture the full fire and impact of her
delivery on paper, but as nearly as possible this is what she said:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>On
a warm September afternoon in 1995, the national Hairston clan was celebrating
its twenty-second annual reunion in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Winston-Salem</st1:City>,
 <st1:State w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:State></st1:place>. Hundreds of
family members drove south in a caravan of cars and buses to see the Cooleemee
Plantation. Judge Peter Hairston guided visitors through the house and
described the history of the plantation. One of the leaders of the Hairston
clan gathered as many people as he could in the dining room after Judge Peter
had described the history, and the leader thanked the judge for taking them
through the rooms and describing the history. To an outsider it seemed an
awkward moment--African Americans standing in a mansion their enslaved
forbearers had helped build and hearing the history of the plantation from the
white owner. But the leader went on to explain that it was important to hear
the history and to visit the plantation because he said, &quot;Our blood is in
this soil.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
was born on this plantation, the third of seven children, raised by my parents
and paternal grandparents, who were share croppers on the plantation. I walked
three miles to a segregated school until the third grade, after which I was
bused nineteen miles from home for grades four through twelve, passing some
white schools along the way and using their hand-me-down books. In spite of
having to rise so early for the bus, I really enjoyed school but detested
having to stay out usually two consecutive weeks at a time in the fall and in
the spring to pick cotton.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
remember one fall day when my two older siblings and I had been taken to the
place where the hundreds of acres of cotton were planted. We were picking
cotton that afternoon. We had gotten about fifty yards down the cotton row, and
I leaned forward to pick this beautiful cotton out of the cotton boll. Lying on
the ground was a long, black snake. I was frightened, but my brother convinced
me that we must continue with our task for the day. I kept on picking. I had
gone another twenty yards down the cotton row, and when I leaned forward to
pick this beautiful cotton from the cotton bowl, I looked down on the ground.
There was a brown snake. I looked around, and there were another and another.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Those
of you who picked cotton know that I am telling you the way it is. We all ran
as fast as we could until we reached a trailer parked at the beginning of the
cotton row packed with several bags of cotton. I was so frightened I climbed
into a bag on the very top, and I sat and thought, &quot;There must be a better
way of life for me.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Immediately
after high school I went to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New York</st1:place></st1:State>
to work as a live-in maid. I was responsible for the care of an eight-year-old
girl with a terminal illness. At the end of the summer she passed away. The
family assisted me financially in returning to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:place></st1:State> to pursue a career in
nursing. Unfortunately, I did not become a candidate when I failed the eye exam
because of the early stages of retinitis pigmentosa. So I enrolled in <st1:State
w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:State>'s <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Central</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">University</st1:PlaceType>, <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Duram</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">North Carolina</st1:State></st1:place>,
and was invited to stay with an aunt and uncle who lived near the campus. While
in college I became involved in the civil rights movement of the sixties. I
joined Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in a sit-in demonstration protesting Sears,
Roebuck and Company's refusal to hire blacks.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
recall an evening during one of our protest marches when some whites were
throwing rocks, stones, eggs, and all kinds of debris. Despite the turmoil, we
continued undaunted to march and sing:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
shall overcome,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

shall overcome some day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Deep
in our hearts,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
do believe<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
shall overcome some day.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>We
continued to sing and march, and when we reached the parking lot of Sears,
Roebuck, and Company, we all sat down. Buses pulled up. It seemed as though
they were going to run over us. People began to scream. The police moved in and
ordered us to leave. Refusing the order, we remained steadfast in our sitting
position. And at that time we started singing again:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Over
my head, I see freedom in the air.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

must be a God somewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>At
that point the police moved in closer, began to pick us up, throw us on the
buses, and haul us to jail. We continued to sing. We were shouting--no
violence--but we continued to sing. We were told that the jail keeper had had a
heart attack and died.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
was deeply concerned that this entire experience would bring embarrassment and
repercussions for my family. My greatest fear was that my aunt and uncle would
pack me up and send me back to the plantation. None of my family members were
supportive of my involvement in the movement.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>After
college I moved to <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State>
to begin my teaching career. I had earned my degree the old-fashioned
way--determination and hard work, working my way through to pay the tuition. I
began my teaching career. A short four years later my eye sight rapidly
deteriorated, and I was forced to resign. I was devastated, felt sorry for
myself, ran from job to job. You see, I didn't look blind. I felt insecure,
and, believe it or not, I was in denial about my impending blindness.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Finally
in 1983 I felt as if I was still sitting on top of that bag of cotton. I knew
there had to be a better way of life for me, and I must press on. I applied for
a position with the Camden Department of Health and Human Services. All that
they could offer me was an entry-level position, counselor trainee. When I was
being interviewed by the director, I was challenged by his negative attitude
towards blindness. He tried to discourage me by saying that I would need to
observe the clients' body language visually in order to get the job. I
countered by saying, &quot;Auditory clues can be just as effective. For
example,&quot; I said, &quot;You just crossed your legs.&quot; I had no
blindness skills; I was faking my way through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
received a call in 1987 from Judy Sanders and Jackie Billey inviting me to an
NFB convention in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:City>, <st1:State
 w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>. I made excuses. I was a single
parent. I didn't know what would happen to my job if I left for a week. So I
said, &quot;Let's compromise.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Jackie
Billey said, &quot;Come for four days at least.&quot; I took the plane. I
arrived in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:City>, <st1:State
 w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>, at the hotel, and all I could hear
was canes tapping--dogs licking my legs, and I just didn't know what I was
going to do. Someone invited me to the buffet. I went through the buffet line
sticking my fingers in the mashed potatoes and using the gravy as a finger
bowl. I had no blindness skills. Going through the registration line I was
asked, &quot;Would you like a Braille or print agenda?&quot; I could no longer
read print, and I certainly didn't know Braille. A light bulb went off for me.
I thought, &quot;I am illiterate.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
talked to as many people as I could at that convention in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City
 w:st="on">Phoenix</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Arizona</st1:State></st1:place>.
I learned of the NFB centers. From then to 1990 I continued to fake my way
through, but I knew that there was hope. I called the <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
<st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType> for the Blind in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Ruston</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:State></st1:place>,
and spoke to Joanne Wilson. I didn't know that I was calling her home, of
course, at 6:00 a.m. I didn't care. I needed help. When Joanne answered the
phone, she said, &quot;Come down.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
did. I attended the <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Louisiana</st1:PlaceName>
 <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">Center</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for the Blind in
1990 and 1991. I returned to <st1:State w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:State> now
with my blindness skills--Braille, computer, cane travel--returning to <st1:State
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:place></st1:State> anxious to
integrate these skills into both my professional and personal lives. I continued
to move up the ladder on my job, taking the civil service exam, being met with
a lot of resistance along the way. You see, when I went there as
counselor/trainee, no one thought that I would ever make it through the year.
Now I could see myself moving up past them because now I had become senior
counselor.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
have to tell you one of the things that helped to do it and to build my
confidence. While attending the center, I thought they were crazy when they
told me I had to go to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">New Orleans</st1:City></st1:place>
to Mardi Gras. While the students and staff were attending Mardi Gras, we were
taken to the parade. We were told that we would be split up into teams, so
there I was with three other students. We were plowing through the crowds of
people with our long white canes in hand, and some of the people wanted to pray
for us. Some laughed and joked and made fun of us. One man even asked,
&quot;Are you going fishing?&quot; The one that took the cake for me was the
man who said, &quot;Three blind mice, see how they run. Three blind mice, see how
they run.&quot; But you know, what was important about that was, having
participated in the civil rights movement, I knew that it was important for me
to focus on the task rather than the people.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
moved back to <st1:State w:st="on">New Jersey</st1:State> after the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">New Orleans</st1:place></st1:City> experience with
confidence I had never had before. In 1991 two other blind people and I
organized the Garden State Chapter of the National Federation of the Blind of
New Jersey. I continued to move up the ladder on my job, becoming supervisor in
the department. I am responsible for supervising eight case managers and four
clerical staff personnel. Some people were there when I began who never thought
that I would make it, and now I am their supervisor. However, I continued to be
challenged by them because some of them still feel that they are not going to
be supervised by a black, blind, female person. However, with the confidence I
have today, and believing in myself, I have no problem writing them up for
insubordination. Incidentally, before I came here to <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">Atlanta</st1:place></st1:City> this week, I had to do just that. One
person was suspended. I said, &quot;Great, I don't have to worry about his
causing problems while I am away.&quot;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Some
of my responsibilities include conducting daily staff meetings, where I have to
supervise case managers--reviewing their cases and assigning tasks. I report to
the director of the Department of Health and Human Services at the county and
state level. I also conduct workshops in which I train and teach alcohol and
drug education to indigent clients of Camden County--people who have an
addiction to alcohol or other drugs--a population that is very difficult, but
it touches every one of us here on the job, in our homes, or in our lives in
one way or another. I do believe that addiction is a disease and that those people
deserve an opportunity to change as we do.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>I
travel independently and work in the courtroom every week as an advocate for
these people. I believe it is more economical and cost-effective for us to give
them rehabilitation rather than jail them. I am also responsible for
representing the agency in meetings throughout the state. Some things that I am
very proud of in addition: I have traveled to northern Africa and to southern <st1:place
w:st="on">Europe</st1:place>. I have climbed the Dunn's river falls in <st1:place
w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Ocho Rios</st1:City>, <st1:country-region w:st="on">Jamaica</st1:country-region></st1:place>.
I have climbed <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Sassafras</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">Mountain</st1:PlaceType> in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">South

Year for <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:PlaceName w:st="on">Camden</st1:PlaceName> <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">County</st1:PlaceType></st1:place> for my leadership as a
supervisor. In 1999 I was also named Woman of the Year for my leadership in the
community by the National Association of Negro Business and Professional
Women's Clubs, Incorporated, of which I am a founder. Also in 1999 I was on
national TV, &quot;Sixty Minutes Two,&quot; where they were featuring a book
written about my family, Hairstons, an American Family in Black and White. Just
before coming to this convention another great challenge led by Vito DeSantis
and John Reef, the challenge course, forty feet in the air on the ropes.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Change,
ladies and gentlemen: that's what it's all about. &quot;C&quot; is for courage,
taking a risk and making a commitment. &quot;H&quot; is for honesty. I had to
learn, &quot;To thine own self be true.&quot; &quot;A&quot; is for
assertiveness. Be direct. &quot;N.&quot; It was necessary for me to make some
changes along the way. &quot;G&quot; is for God for me, my choice, my higher
power. &quot;E&quot; is for excitement. We must smile and enjoy what we do in
the Federation. None of us can achieve success entirely on our own. But with
God; the encouragement and support of family and friends; and the most powerful
organization in the world for the blind, the National Federation of the Blind,
we can effect change. Coming together is a beginning. Keeping together is a
process. Working together is success.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<h2>MANAGING <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">READING</st1:City></st1:place>
ON THE JOB</h2>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>by
Mary Ellen Gabias<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>As
Monitor readers know, Mary Ellen Gabias (formerly Mary Ellen Reihing) is
Assistant Director of the Job Opportunities for the Blind (JOB) program. She is
especially knowledgeable about what it takes for blind persons really to be
competitive in the job market. Here is what she had to say in the Spring/Summer,
1988, Future Reflections, the magazine of the Parents of Blind Children
Division of the National Federation of the Blind. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Literacy,
broadly defined, is the ability to deal effectively with the written word.
Sometimes this means creating well-organized, properly spelled and punctuated
text. At other times, it means the ability to read and interpret the work done
by others. For sighted individuals, literacy involves mastery of print
communication whether it is done by pen, pencil, typewriter, or computer. For
the blind, literacy involves mastery of a number of distinctly different
systems. Braille is clearly the most analogous to print. It is the only system
of literacy for blind people which permits the user to read, write, and review
material rapidly and efficiently.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
major drawback to Braille is that there simply is not enough of it. It is
estimated that far less than one percent of the information printed each year
is made available in Braille. Therefore, blind people must integrate their use
of Braille into a system of functioning which enables them to use print
information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>If
the required information is available in machine readable (computer) form,
speech synthesis or conversion into Braille is possible and quite efficient. If
not, the use of a human reader is still the most flexible and dependable
technique for accessing print information.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>To
understand the proper role of the reader, we must begin by distinguishing
between appearance and reality. Is the use of a reader an admission of
dependency, or is it a viable method for increasing efficiency? The answer will
depend on individual circumstances. Here are some general guidelines to
consider. What is the nature of the job to <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>done?
The amount of print reading, in and of itself, is less important than its
purpose. For example, both a blind executive and a blind file clerk may require
a great deal of reader time. Even so, it may be wise for the executive to get a
reader and foolish for the file clerk to do so. The executive is hired to
synthesize information and make decisions. The file clerk is hired primarily
for the ability to read and sort print. By the time a file clerk trained a
reader to do the necessary reading, that reader could do the entire file clerk
job. A reader trained to work for an executive would not have the necessary
background or experience to make executive decisions.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Can
the necessary reading be done in definable blocks of time, or must it be spread
intermittently throughout the work day? If a blind worker knows that a reader
will be needed every Tuesday from eight in the morning until noon, planning is
easy. If the worker needs readers for three minutes at a time, but those three
minutes occur randomly, planning is more difficult. This does not mean that blind
people cannot cope with flexible work assignments. A little ingenuity can turn
a potential problem into an opportunity for increased efficiency for the whole
organization.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Blind
people preparing for jobs in the year 2000 cannot afford to ignore the issue of
sighted readers. The computer will not remove the need. Neither will increased
Braille literacy, though both will help blind people use the readers they have
more efficiently. Blind workers must know where to find readers, how to work
with them, and how to integrate their use into the job setting. The first day
on a new job is not the time to learn these lessons.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Training
programs which prepare the sighted for jobs are not designed to help blind
people wrestle with these questions. Unfortunately, the rehabilitation programs
for the blind often do not deal effectively with them, either.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Blind
people learn about readers primarily through trial and error and by talking
with more experienced blind colleagues. As is true with most blindness issues,
the best solutions come from a philosophically consistent understanding of
blindness and not from rigid rules. Here are a few examples of situations where
the use of a reader has been an asset to everyone concerned. Mr. Jones was a
high school English teacher. He had fifty or more papers to grade each night.
He also had in-class assignments to supervise. His reading demands were quite
heavy, but he found a way to use his need as a teaching tool. He carefully
disguised the authorship of papers and used them to teach his students about
grammar, punctuation, and style. The students gained a depth of understanding
they would not have had if Mr. Jones had simply corrected their papers in red
ink. Mr. Jones worked with a local college to find readers. He hired education
students who wanted to know what teaching was really like. The students earned
spending money and course credits while gaining experience. Mr. Jones got his
papers graded. Mr. Charles worked as a maintenance mechanic in a large
hospital. His job required that he read a log book. He was also expected to
write in the daily log to keep coworkers informed of maintenance projects in
progress. Since Mr. Charles could not see to read or write in the log book,
other maintenance mechanics would read it to him at the beginning of the shift.
When his shift ended, Mr. Charles would dictate his entries to the mechanic who
relieved him.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Miss
Winchester worked in an office where she was expected to analyze proposed
legislation and report on its potential impact. She also answered telephones
when the receptionist needed to be away from the desk. She hired a reader for
major assignments, but occasionally she asked the receptionist to read short
documents.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>There
was no dictaphone equipment in the office, so most staff members drafted their
documents in longhand for the receptionist to type. Miss Winchester typed hers
from Braille notes. Often her documents needed only minor corrections. Miss
Winchester's methods saved work for the receptionist. Even so, she sometimes
had trouble getting the receptionist to do reading. The receptionist seemed to
believe that asking sighted coworkers to decipher their handwriting was part of
the job, but reading aloud to a blind colleague was doing her a favor. Miss
Winchester's efficiency suffered because of this artificial distinction. So did
the overall efficiency of the office. The receptionist was astonished when Miss
Winchester pointed this out to her. Once the receptionist began thinking in
broader terms, Miss Winchester had no trouble getting reading done.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Mr.
Jones, Mr. Charles, and Miss Winchester needed readers for different tasks. Mr.
Charles needed minimal reading help. Mr. Jones needed a great deal. Miss
Winchester needed readers frequently, but for brief periods. Each of them
understood the necessity for keeping control and taking responsibility. Each
thought carefully about how and when to use readers. Cost was not an issue in
any of these cases. Mr. Jones hired his own readers and used volunteers when he
could. <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Reading</st1:place></st1:City>
was such an incidental, although important, part of Mr. Charles' job that the
few minutes it took to complete the log had no economic impact at all. Miss
Winchester's alternative techniques saved the receptionist more time than Miss
Winchester needed for reading.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Blind
workers and their employers have found innovative ways to handle reading costs.
The most effective approaches permit the blind person to retain control of the
use of readers. Mr. Craig is an accountant for a large savings and loan. He
hired, supervised, and paid accounting students from a local community college
to read for him. In the interest of efficiency, his readers did certain
clerical tasks which other accountants used the typing pool to do. His employer
recognized that Mr. Craig's techniques were saving the company money.
Therefore, they reimbursed him for part of his expenses. Mr. Curtis began work
as a computer programmer before Braille or speech access to computers was
practical. He hired people to read print-outs and computer manuals. Although
the employer was willing to pay for readers, Mr. Curtis insisted on bearing the
entire cost himself. The readers always knew that Mr. Curtis, not the company
supervisor, was the boss. Later the company bought a speech terminal for Mr.
Curtis. They also promoted him to management, which entitled him to some
secretarial support. Mr. Curtis did not hesitate to ask his secretary to read
to him. However, he still hired readers from time to time when his reading
workload was heavy. Each of these individuals devised a strategy for using
readers based on personal preference and the characteristics of the job. All of
them began by understanding the use of readers as one more job skill. They
resisted the temptation to think of their methods as inferior substitutes for
sight. As a result, their overall performance was an asset to their employers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Bullis has been writing a series of open letters to blind people. The topics

font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Like most of you I
started out thirty years ago looking for employment in all the traditional
ways. I printed up r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, had people read me the want ads, and
went to job interviews. Job hunting was a lottery with very long odds. I
printed up r&eacute;sum&eacute;s fifty at a time and was out knocking on doors
from early morning to late afternoon. Mostly looking for a job was a series of
disappointments culminating in the lucky result that with a great deal of
persistence I finally found employment. I never felt particularly good about
the process but didn't know any other way to accomplish my goal. I assumed that
everybody did it that way.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Over time I
discovered that, although I always seemed to get jobs, they seldom came through
the job lottery of r&eacute;sum&eacute;s and interviews with people I didn't
know. Thanks to teachers like Richard Bolles, who wrote What Color Is Your
Parachute, and friends who steered me in the right directions, I've turned job
hunting into--if not a truly pleasurable experience--at least one that
regularly yields positive results. You can do the same.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>First, forget
everything you've been taught and start over. Below is my guaranteed success
formula for finding employment. The only reason it won't work is if you don't
work it. Well, okay, there are a few caveats. The system will work faster and
more fluidly if you are able to do a few things to help yourself. First, you
must know how to gather information through research and good listening skills.
Second, you need to be a good conversationalist--listening more than you talk.
Third, you should make a presentable appearance in your dress and social
mannerisms--no rocking or putting your fingers in your eyes. Finally, and this
is a big one, you need to know how to be socially pleasant--not abrasive or
socially obnoxious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>1. Since one out of
fifteen hundred r&eacute;sum&eacute;s sent to an unknown employer results in a
job, stop sending them out to people you haven't spoken to unless there simply
isn't any other way to reach a specific employer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>2. Since going to job
interviews with personnel departments at companies where you don't know anyone
seldom results in employment, stop that as well. If you know of job openings at
a particular company, find out who the supervisor or manager is and go speak
with that person. Personnel departments can seldom hire; they can only say,
&quot;No&quot;--not what you want to hear. Yes, most companies still allow
supervisors to hire their own staff, so those are the people you want to see.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>3. Since want ads are
sixth or seventh on the list of ways employers use to hire, stop reading them
unless you use them to help you locate companies with vacancies, but don't
bother answering the ads. There are much better ways to get hired.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The nice thing about
stopping all these behaviors that seldom result in jobs is that they are
typically the most dreary, frustrating, and painful parts of the job search.
The reason they are dreary and painful is that they require you to prepare for
a long series of nos. Regular and frustrating rejection is the name of the game
when you use traditional methods of job search. It's hard on your self-image
and, frankly, very inefficient. So now that we've removed the most unpleasant
aspects of getting a job, what's left? Below are the ABC's of locating your
ideal job.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Read every article you can find about the companies you're interested in and
the field generally. If articles have been written about key people, read them
as well. In other words, become conversant with the business. Even if you want
to become a hamburger flipper, you should know about the business. What are its
biggest challenges? What are its rewards? What are its management issues? Tell
every friend and acquaintance what you're interested in doing. You'll be
surprised how often they know somebody in the company or field of interest and
can set you up with an informational interview. More about this technique
later, but suffice it to say you should do your research--learn the jargon and
other topical issues in the field. You'd be surprised at how many applicants
are so interested in their own needs that they fail to do this basic research
and demonstrate a true interest in what the employer is looking for. Here are
some things you should know:<o:p></o:p></span></p>

employers hire is from people they know or that someone they know knows. Your
main focus should be on getting to know the people who can hire you. Another
thing to remember: employers would rather hire someone who is trainable and
easy to get along with than someone with all the skills necessary but who
creates problems on the job. If you are armed with these facts, your goal is
easy. Begin telephoning people in key positions at companies you may wish to
work for. If the company has thirty or fewer employees, talk to the owner or
president. If more than thirty, pick an upper-level manager.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

don't go to personnel. Tell the person you want to speak to them that you are
conducting informational interviews and would like to meet with them to talk
about their company, the field generally, its plusses and minuses, and how they
themselves got into it. You'd be surprised at how easy it is. All of us love to
talk about ourselves and our companies. They will conclude that you're bright,

discussion the person you are interviewing may speculate about how a blind
person could do the necessary work. Try to avoid this because the person
probably has little or no knowledge about blindness. You should assume
responsibility and take control of the conversation by saying, &quot;If you
were to hire a blind person, he or she should take responsibility for knowing
how to get the job done.&quot; Then move on to the next question. Don't get
involved in guessing games about how this or that circumstance could be
handled. You're here to learn about the field, not to discuss blindness.
Usually potential employers will be impressed if you simply state that figuring
out these details would be the responsibility of the blind employee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ends--pieces of information, possible contacts, etc.--that aren't immediately
available, never leave it to a potential employer to get back to you. You
should say, &quot;I'm really hard to reach, so why don't I call you? When would
be a good time?&quot; Try never to get yourself in the position of waiting for
calls. When you have asked your last question, get up and leave. More
interviews have been ruined by staying too long than for almost any other
reason. This employer is busy, and so are you, so get out as soon as you
reasonably can.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

suggested that this process is a bit dishonest. That is, if you disguise the
fact that you're looking for a job, isn't that deceptive? Yes, it certainly
would be deceptive, so that's not what I am recommending. If you really don't
think you can learn anything by talking to middle managers and CEO's, you
shouldn't conduct the interviews. I am proposing that the more information you
gain the better able you will be to contribute to the field professionally and
that these informational interviews are an honest process through which to
educate yourself. I am also quite certain that, if you are going to get very
far in any field, you need to know the people who are doing the hiring.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

interview with a thank-you note (either by email or snail mail) and a
r&eacute;sum&eacute; (always by snail mail). Your r&eacute;sum&eacute;s should
be crafted to address the particular job and employer. Focus on the work you
have done that relates to this particular field, the problems you solved, the
methods you used to solve them, and the results achieved. What jobs you have
done are often of less interest in your r&eacute;sum&eacute; than the skills
and traits you brought to the tasks. In our hamburger-flipper example, rather
than talking about working full-time at McDonald's, you might say: 2000-2002
Hamburger Flipper at McDonald's. Reorganized grill area, which resulted in 11
percent efficiency increase. Reduced food waste by 3 percent. Was willing to
work any and all shifts necessary. Received Company Award for Kitchen
Cleanliness and implemented cleanliness plans throughout store, resulting in a

It's all about not just showing what you did but the value it contributed to
the organization. Employers are smart enough to know that, if you are a problem
solver in one organization, you will do the same for them as well. Never
mention pay rates in a r&eacute;sum&eacute; or if particular work was as a
volunteer. It doesn't matter and will only raise irrelevant issues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

r&eacute;sum&eacute; to the information-gathering interview. After your
discussion you might find a different way to word a particular skill. Besides,
sending your r&eacute;sum&eacute; later gives you another chance to put your
name in front of the employer. If he or she liked you, that
r&eacute;sum&eacute; will not only be on file but on his or her mind. And he or
she will probably like you if you asked good questions, were interested in the
answers, had done your homework about the company and field, and got the heck

I can guarantee it, is that, as you interview people, you will learn lots of
things about the field others may not know and increase your value to employers
in the process. Your blindness won't be a major factor because you are not
asking for a job; you are just collecting information. Employers hate job
interviews as much as you do. You have taken the pressure off them to make a
decision. In a far shorter time than by using old methods, you will have a job
offer.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

of the process I've outlined here. For them the unemployment rate is 0 percent
because they have eliminated the less productive parts of the job search and
concentrated their energies on those activities most likely to yield results.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

blindness-related journals I have been reading recently, I have noticed
comments that bothered me. The authors argued that the traditional blind trades
were inferior to regular jobs and should be avoided as career choices. This
wasn't said in so many words; however, the message was obvious.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>In the past agencies
serving the blind offered only a few training choices to their clients wanting
to work. If the client wanted to be trained for a career outside of a narrow
list of approved careers, the agency refused to help and told clients they were
on their own. So many blind people over the years were trained for careers that
were not their first choice in order to receive the financial assistance they
needed. As a result many people spent their lives in jobs they didn't want and
were unsuited for. They were forced by bad luck and bad advice into one of the
so-called blind trades.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

women have far more choices. Largely because of the work of the National
Federation of the Blind and its efforts to reform the agencies, blind people no
longer have to settle for the very limited career choices their predecessors
had. It is understandable that people still feel some disinclination to choose
a career in a blind trade. But in an effort to exert our new ability to choose,
some people are unfairly denigrating the blind trades and those who work in
them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

ago I adopted a piano from a Federation friend who no longer wanted it. It was
in pretty good condition considering that it was built when my parents were in
high school. One thing it did need, however, was a tuning. As soon as the piano
arrived, I got a call from another Federation friend who is a piano tuner. He
wanted to set up an appointment for tuning my instrument.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

appointment came, so did the tuner. He was right on time. Being a curious
person, I asked if I could watch while he fixed my piano. He agreed and began
to work. We talked about pianos and about his career as a tuner. He had freely
chosen and now loved his career. He described traveling from one appointment to
another and explained that he had to look for new clients constantly while
taking care of his current ones. A bit over an hour later he was done tuning
the piano and giving me an education. He had a new client, and I had a new
respect for a self-employed entrepreneur who happened to be blind.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

One of those duties is interviewing perspective employees. After interviewing

effectively, cultivating new business opportunities.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

was solely responsible for arranging his transportation and making sure that he
acquired the latest training. If he got sick and couldn't work, he did not get
paid. If he wanted to take a vacation, he again lost income for that time. The
success or failure of the business was completely his responsibility. Few

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
job interview is probably the most crucial step on the path to becoming
employed. It is your best opportunity to make a favorable impression on a
prospective employer. It may also be your only opportunity to educate the
employer about the abilities of a blind person and to make him or her feel
comfortable with your blindness. However, because the Americans with
Disabilities Act of 1990 (<st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City>)
prohibits employers from asking disability-related questions during an
interview, you may need to take charge of the process and raise the questions
yourself. To do this you must understand what questions are permitted by the <st1:City
w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City> and which ones are
prohibited. This article briefly explains the difference between permissible
and impermissible questions, suggests some strategies for taking charge during
the interview, and explains some options you may have if you believe your
rights were violated.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
rules governing pre-employment disability-related questions are complicated, as
well as controversial. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)
enforces the employment provisions of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City>
and issues interpretative regulations and guidelines. On October 10, 1995, the
EEOC issued an Enforcement Guidance intended to clarify the questions which may
be asked during a job interview. The guidance, Number 915.002, is titled
&quot;Pre-employment Disability-Related Questions and Medical
Examinations.&quot; You can obtain the full text of the guidance from the EEOC
Web page, http://www.eeoc.gov You may also obtain the guidance by calling the
EEOC publications center at (800) 669-EEOC. The guidance is available in
alternate accessible formats. Because this article can examine this complicated

to the passage of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City>,
it was common for employers to ask job applicants about their medical or
physical conditions. Now, since the enactment of the <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place
 w:st="on">ADA</st1:place></st1:City>, an employer cannot ask
disability-related questions unless a job offer has been made. Before a job
offer, employers cannot ask questions that are likely to elicit information
about a disability, ask whether an applicant has a particular disability, or
ask questions that are closely related to a disability. For instance, an
employer cannot ask if you are blind or ask questions about the level of any
partial vision you have. This type of information was often used to exclude
blind applicants categorically before their ability to perform the job had ever
been considered. These questions are now prohibited to ensure that persons with
disabilities are given an equal opportunity to apply for a job without regard
to their disability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Although
an employer may not ask disability-related questions during the interview, if
the interview includes a process such as a written test, an employer may ask
whether you need a reasonable accommodation for the interview. During the
interview employers are allowed to ask questions to determine if you are
qualified for the job. For instance, an employer may ask if you can perform job
functions, including whether you can perform them with or without reasonable
accommodations. Employers may also ask a job applicant to describe or
demonstrate how he or she would perform specific job functions, as long as all
applicants in the job category are asked to do this. For example, if the job
function included computer use, you could explain how assistive technology
(such as a speech synthesizer) might enable you to use computers.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>An
employer may also state the physical requirements of a job (such as the ability
to lift heavy weights or to climb ladders) and ask if you can satisfy these
requirements. Some employers who are unfamiliar with blindness may not understand
that a blind person can climb ladders or perform other manual tasks, and you
should take this opportunity to explain how you could negotiate the work site.
Employers may also ask applicants to disclose their disabilities voluntarily
for purposes of affirmative action programs.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Employers
are also allowed to ask about your qualifications, work history, education, and
job skills. Because employers are allowed to ask about your qualifications,
they can ask if you have required certifications and licenses. For example, an
employer may ask if you have a driver's license, but only if driving is a
job-related duty. Unfortunately, it is still common for employers to require a
driver's license, even though the travel could be accomplished by using public transportation,
cabs, or drivers. If you encounter this situation, you should explain to the
employer that you could perform the travel using these alternative methods. A
driver's license should be required only for jobs such as a police officer, bus
driver, or delivery truck driver.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Many
employers do not know what questions they are allowed to ask to determine
whether you are qualified to perform the job. Also, an employer may well not
understand what types of reasonable accommodations would enable you to perform
the job. The new EEOC guidance attempts to address this problem by giving the
employer additional leeway to ask questions in the case of a person with a
disability. If an employer might reasonably believe that an applicant was
unable to perform a job function because of a known disability, the employer
may ask that particular applicant to describe or demonstrate how he or she
would perform the function, even if other applicants were not asked this same
question.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>For
instance, your disability would be a &quot;known disability&quot; if you came
to the interview using a white cane or guide dog, so the interviewer would be
allowed to ask you to describe or demonstrate how you would perform specific
job functions. If you say that you would need a reasonable accommodation to
perform the job, the employer may ask you questions about the accommodation.
Accordingly, you should educate yourself in advance about what reasonable
accommodations you will need. For instance, if you say that you need a speech
synthesizer, the employer is allowed to ask who makes the speech synthesizer
and if it is compatible with the employer's computer system. You should be
prepared to answer this type of question and do so with confidence and
authority.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
EEOC guidance attempts to explain some subtle distinctions between the
questions that are allowed and the ones which are prohibited. For instance, an
employer may ask if you &quot;can perform the job with or without reasonable
accommodations,&quot; but may not ask if you &quot;need a reasonable
accommodation to perform the job.&quot; The first question is allowed because
answering either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; does not reveal the presence
of a disability, while answering &quot;yes&quot; to the second question would
reveal the presence of a disability.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>The
distinctions are equally subtle in the case of physical testing. For instance,
an employer may give vision tests to applicants before a job offer, provided
that the test is not a &quot;medical&quot; exam. The EEOC guidance states that
&quot;evaluating someone's ability to read labels or distinguish objects as
part of a demonstration of the person's ability to do the job is not a medical
examination.&quot; However, the EEOC guidance also states that an
ophthalmologist's examination is medical (as is requiring an individual to read
an eye chart). If you are asked to demonstrate your ability to read, you should
keep in mind that you may request a reasonable accommodation for the reading
test, or you may describe what reasonable accommodations could enable you to
perform the reading. This is a crucial moment for you to educate your potential
employer about your ability to perform the job,and you should not miss the
opportunity. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Despite
your best efforts to educate a potential employer, you may still be rejected
for the job. If the employer rejects you after a disability-related question or
medical examination, you may file a complaint with the EEOC, which will
&quot;closely scrutinize&quot; whether the rejection was based on the results
of that question or examination.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;mso-bidi-font-family:"Times New Roman"'>Persons
who have a &quot;hidden disability,&quot; such as a psychiatric disorder, may
choose not to disclose the existence of the disability during the interview. If
the employer does not know of the existence of the disability, the employer
will not be able to exclude the applicant based on the disability. By contrast,
blindness is usually obvious to the employer. Because the employer is normally
aware of the disability, a blind person is in a different position from a
person with a hidden disability. Since the employer will be aware of your
disability but may not know what kinds of questions may be asked, you must be
prepared voluntarily to describe and demonstrate how you can perform the job.
This means that you must thoroughly research the job and the reasonable
accommodations you will require long before you walk into the interview. One of
the best ways to do this is to talk to blind persons who are successfully
employed in similar jobs. By being prepared and informed about your rights, you
may discover a world of new employment opportunities waiting for you.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
