Headings Assignment

Headings are a great way to browse through a web page, particularly large ones with many sections. Headings are used visually to separate sections of text; the tend to be in larger darker fonts that will cath someone’s attention more easily.
Headings come in different levels to denote larger and smaller sections. For example, the title of a page might be at heading level one, major sections might be at level two, and smaller sections might be at level three. Note that the larger the number, the smaller the section. Every web site is different in how it uses headings, so it’s good to explore them on your own.
Remember that typing H will move you to the next heading and shift plus H moves you to the previous heading.. Also, pressing any of the numbers one through six will move you to the next heading at that level.
